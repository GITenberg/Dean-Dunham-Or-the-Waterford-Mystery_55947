<span class="small">ADIN DUNHAM SURPRISES HIS WIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"I've been looking forward to this day for weeks,
Sarah," said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table
on a certain Wednesday morning in the early
part of June.</p>

<p>"Why, father, what do you mean?" asked Mrs.
Dunham curiously.</p>

<p>"Because to-day I am to receive a thousand dollars&mdash;a
thousand dollars in hard cash," answered her
husband in a tone of exultation.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" ejaculated his wife in amazement.
"Who on earth is going to give you a thousand
dollars?"</p>

<p>"No one is going to give it to me; it's my own."</p>

<p>"How strangely you do talk, Adin Dunham! You
ain't out of your mind, be you?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>"Not as I know of," answered her husband with
an amused smile.</p>

<p>"Is it really true that somebody is going to pay
you a thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"And you say it is your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said Mrs. Dunham, with
the air of one to whom a puzzle is propounded and
who gives it up.</p>

<p>"Then I'll explain. You know when Uncle Dan
died he left me a piece of stony pasture land in
Rockmount?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. You never could sell it, I've
heard you say ag'in and ag'in."</p>

<p>"Well, I've sold it at last. There's a company
goin' to put up a big hotel just on that spot, and
they've offered me a thousand dollars for the land."</p>

<p>"Couldn't they find a better buildin' lot than that?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see it's located near the lake, and
though it's barren enough it's well situated, and
there's five acres of it, plenty of room for all the
buildin's required. They offered me first seven
hundred, then eight hundred, and finally when they
got up to a thousand I caved in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I agreed to let 'em have it. I'm going
over to-day to get the money."</p>

<p>"Why, it'll make us rich, Adin. I never expected
you'd be wuth a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"I wonder what Uncle Dan would have said if he'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
thought I would have got so much for the land. He
never cared much for me, and he only left me that
because he thought it wasn't wuth anything. He
did better by me than he expected."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the money,
Adin?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. I'll keep it by me till I've
decided. Perhaps I'll invest in gov'ment bonds. I
guess they're about as safe as anything."</p>

<p>"So I've heard, Adin. I suppose the gov'ment
ain't likely to fail."</p>

<p>"If it is, I guess all the banks will fail too."</p>

<p>"How are you goin' over to Rockmount?"</p>

<p>"I'll borrow neighbor Gould's horse and buggy.
That horse is pretty strong, and he won't mind the
twenty miles&mdash;ten there and ten back."</p>

<p>"I don't like to have you travelin' so far with all
that money. S'pose you should meet with robbers."</p>

<p>"There ain't any robbers round here, Sarah. This
is a respectable community."</p>

<p>"You might meet a tramp."</p>

<p>"Well, the chances are that he'd be more afraid of
me than I would be of him. I ain't a child, Sarah.
I can lift a barrel of potatoes and put it in a wagon as
easy as most men."</p>

<p>"Well, Adin, you know best. Hadn't you better
take Dean with you?"</p>

<p>"Why should I take Dean?"</p>

<p>"It would be safer for two than for one."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that I need a boy of sixteen
to protect me? If I thought I did, I'd stay at
home and send Dean by himself."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Adin, I don't want to interfere. It wouldn't
be much use, either, for you generally have your
own way. Have you told any of the neighbors that
you are goin' for some money?"</p>

<p>"No except Lawyer Bates."</p>

<p>"What made you tell him?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was in his office the other evenin', and
somehow I was led into tellin' it. I gave a sort of
hint, and the lawyer he drew it out of me. Them
lawyers are great on cross-examinin', you know."</p>

<p>"What did Squire Bates say?"</p>

<p>"He told me I'd better not tell anybody else. He
talked for all the world just like you did, Sarah. You
haven't been chatterin' with the squire, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, Adin, I don't like him well enough for that.
I never fancied the squire. He's always showin'
those long front teeth of his, like a wild beast."</p>

<p>"They ain't very handsome teeth, I'm bound to
admit, Sarah, but the poor man can't help himself.
He's as God made him."</p>

<p>"He gave you good advice at any rate, Adin.
There's so many dishonest people in the world that
it's best to be careful. Did you tell him when you
were goin' for the money?"</p>

<p>"I don't exactly remember. I guess I did."</p>

<p>"Do you think Squire Bates is a rich man, Adin?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He's a lawyer, and keeps his
affairs mighty close."</p>

<p>"That boy of his&mdash;Brandon&mdash;is his very image,
even to the teeth."</p>

<p>"Well, he does favor his father considerable."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>"Dean doesn't like him. He's a very big feeling
boy. He looks down on Dean because he is the
nephew of a poor man."</p>

<p>"O, he'll get wiser in time. We mustn't mind
them young folks so much. Boys will be boys."</p>

<p>"So they will, but there's different kinds of boys."</p>

<p>"I guess there's room enough in the world for both
of them. If they don't like each other they can keep
apart."</p>

<p>"Dean is an excellent boy. I don't know how we
should get along without him."</p>

<p>"I indorse all that, wife," said Adin Dunham
heartily.</p>

<p>"He's always cheerful and willin'&mdash;always ready
to do chores and give up his own pleasure. I remember
last winter he'd set his heart on going with
a skatin' party, but when I was taken sick, he stayed
at home and tended me, without a word of complaint.
He couldn't have done no more if he'd been a son
instead of a nephew."</p>

<p>"Just so, wife! Just so! He's a likely boy, and
if he keeps on as he's begun he's sure to do well."</p>

<p>"He deserves to prosper, and I hope he will. I
wish we could do more for him."</p>

<p>"So do I, but a carpenter that gets work only about
half the time can't do what he'd like to."</p>

<p>Just then Dean came into the house&mdash;a broad-shouldered,
strongly built boy, with a frank, open
countenance and red cheeks.</p>

<p>"Dean," said his uncle, "won't you go over to
neighbor Gould, and ask if he will lend his horse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
buggy for the day? I'm goin' over to Rockmount."</p>

<p>"Going to Rockmount?" repeated Dean eagerly.
"Will you take me, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Not to-day, Dean. It's a long ride, and it'll be
easier on the horse to carry one than two."</p>

<p>Dean looked disappointed. A ride to Rockmount,
which was a considerably larger place than Waterford,
would have been to him a very agreeable
recreation, but he was not a boy to complain or tease
when a favor had been refused. So he indulged in no
remonstrance, but went over to Mr. Gould's dwelling,
only twenty rods away, and preferred the request.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mr. Gould pleasantly. "So
your uncle has business in Rockmount, has he?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, I suppose so, but he didn't tell me what
it is."</p>

<p>"Well, tell him not to over drive the Captain."
(This was the rather peculiar name of Mr. Gould's
horse.)</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any danger," said Dean
smiling, for he knew that Adin Dunham was one of
the most deliberate of men, and permitted a horse to
select his own pace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="small">SQUIRE RENWICK BATES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Adin Dunham got into the buggy, took the reins
from Dean, and drove away.</p>

<p>The pretentious house of Squire Bates stood a little
way back from the road a quarter of a mile further on.
The lawyer stood in front of his gate. He smiled as
Adin Dunham drove by.</p>

<p>"Well, Dunham," he said, "so you are on your
way to Rockmount?"</p>

<p>"Yes, squire."</p>

<p>"And bound on a pleasant errand, too," continued
Bates, with a second smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, squire. I can't believe it hardly. It's a new
experience for me. I never thought I should be worth
a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's quite a sum. What do you propose to
do with it?"</p>

<p>"I may pay up the mortgage on my place."</p>

<p>"But suppose I don't want to receive it?"</p>

<p>"But why wouldn't you want to receive it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's paying me fairish interest, and I should
have to look up another investment."</p>

<p>"But you could do that better than I."</p>

<p>"Come and see me when you get back, and I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
give you advice. I wouldn't trouble myself for every
one, but you are a friend and neighbor," said Squire
Bates, smiling and showing the long white tusks that
gave him so peculiar an appearance.</p>

<p>"Your advice ought to be good, squire. You are
used to investin' money."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a good deal to invest," said Bates.
"Which way shall you return?" asked the squire
carelessly.</p>

<p>"I thought I might take the creek road, squire."</p>

<p>"If it were my case, I would come through the
woods. It's half a mile shorter."</p>

<p>"That's so, and I did think of it, but you and
my wife talked to me about robbers, till I began to
think the creek road would be safer."</p>

<p>Squire Bates laughed in an amused way.</p>

<p>"I rather think your wife and I talked like old
women," he said. "It seems rather ridiculous to
think of robbers in this neighborhood."</p>

<p>"So it does!" said Adin Dunham eagerly. "I
told Sarah so.</p>

<p>"Then you'll come through the woods?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"About what time?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't stay very long after my business is
done."</p>

<p>"You'll probably pass through about three
o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Well, say four. I've got a cousin in Rockmount
that I shall take dinner with, and that'll take up part
of my time. Then I've got one or two errands to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
at the stores there. I'm to buy my wife a pair of
shoes at Ingals's store. He knows just what she
wants, and always fits her."</p>

<p>"There's one thing I would advise you not to do,
neighbor Dunham."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Don't invite any one to ride home with you."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have considerable money with you
and it might prove a temptation even to a respectable
man. You see to most people it is a large
sum&mdash;not to me, for I am better off than the average,
but I've read in my law books of a good many
crimes that were the result of a sudden impulse.
There's no reason to be nervous, but it's well to be
prudent, neighbor."</p>

<p>"That's good sense, squire. Thank you for your
caution. Well, I must be getting on."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you," said Bates, as he turned and
went into the house.</p>

<p>Squire Bates had been for three years a resident of
Waterford. He appeared to have plenty of money,
though it was a mystery where it came from. He
professed to be a lawyer, and had an office, but beyond
writing a will or a lease, or some such matter,
had no practice to speak of. This, however, did not
seem to trouble him. It was a popular belief that
the care of his property gave him considerable to do.
He had no investments in Waterford except the house
he lived in, and a mortgage on the house and
small landed property of Adin Dunham. The assessors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
got very little satisfaction out of him when
they questioned him about his taxable property.</p>

<p>"I am taxed elsewhere," he said briefly.</p>

<p>"But you have some personal property?"</p>

<p>"Oh well, you may put me down for a thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"It is generally supposed that you have a much
larger personal property than that."</p>

<p>"I have, gentleman," answered Bates frankly,
"but you know that government bonds are not taxable."</p>

<p>That explained it. The board of assessors jumped
to the conclusion that Squire Bates had a large sum
in government bonds, and did not pursue their inquiries
further.</p>

<p>There was one thing that puzzled Waterford people
about the lawyer. He often absented himself
in a mysterious way, sometimes for weeks at a
time. He never told where he went, nor did his
wife and son when questioned appear to know. At
any rate they never gave any information. He
would reappear, as suddenly as he had disappeared,
and always explain briefly that he had been away
on business. What the nature of the business was
he did not state, a sensible thing probably, but his
reticence excited considerable remark among his
fellow-townsmen, who did not approve of it.</p>

<p>When Squire Bates re-entered the house he went
up to his room&mdash;his library was on the second floor&mdash;and
locked the door. He sat down in a rocking-chair,
and seemed plunged in thought.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>"A thousand dollars!" he soliloquized. "It is a
good sum of money. It would be a great lift to
Adin Dunham. It would enable him to pay off the
mortgage on his place, and that would not suit me.
I prefer to foreclose by and by. Upon the whole the
money will be better in my hands than in his. It
was well I suggested to him not to come home by
the creek road. That is too open, and would not suit
my plans."</p>

<p>Lawyer Bates rose, and, taking a key from his
pocket, opened the door of a small closet. It was
a clothes closet evidently, but its contents were of a
curious character. There was one suit that a fastidious
tramp would have scorned to wear. There
were several masks. There were disguises of different
kinds, three wigs, one red, and false beards. Of
what earthly use could these articles be to a respectable
country lawyer?</p>

<p>Not even Mrs. Bates had seen the inside of this
closet. Once she suggested cleaning it, but the curt
refusal with which her proposal was received prevented
her making it again.</p>

<p>"I keep my papers in there," said her husband,
"and I am not willing that they should be disturbed."</p>

<p>"I would be very careful, Renwick," said Mrs.
Bates. "I would attend to it myself."</p>

<p>"You will offend me if you say more, Mrs. Bates,"
said her husband, looking displeased, and she took
the hint.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bates was a pleasant, gentle woman who did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
not put on airs, and she was much more popular in
the village than her husband, whose face had a singularly
disagreeable expression, especially when he
smiled, for then he showed his long white teeth,
which, as Mrs. Dunham expressed it, were like the
fangs of a wild beast.</p>

<p>His son Brandon was like his father, even to the
teeth. He was a boy of cruel instincts, haughty and
imperious, and disposed to lord it over his schoolmates
and companions. He was heartily tired of
Waterford, and had more than once suggested to his
father that it would be wise to leave it.</p>

<p>"When I want your advice, Brandon, I will ask
for it," said Squire Bates briefly.</p>

<p>Brandon did not press the matter. He knew his
father too well, but he complained to his mother.</p>

<p>"What on earth can father be thinking of to stay
in such a quiet hole as Waterford?"</p>

<p>"It is a pleasant village, Brandon," said his mother
gently.</p>

<p>"What is there pleasant about it?"</p>

<p>"The people are pleasant."</p>

<p>"I have no fit associates."</p>

<p>"There is Dean Dunham, who is about your
age."</p>

<p>"I <i>hate</i> him!" said Brandon passionately.</p>

<p>"Why do you hate him, my son? Mrs. Dunham
tells me he is a great comfort to her."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that. He is very
impudent to me. He seems to think he is my
equal."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid you are too proud, Brandon."</p>

<p>"Isn't father the richest man in Waterford, I'd like
to know? Dean Dunham is the nephew of a poor
carpenter, who keeps him out of charity."</p>

<p>"Ah, Brandon, you shouldn't value people for
their money."</p>

<p>"Dean Dunham is no fit companion for me. If I
were in the city, I should find plenty of associates."</p>

<p>Gentle Mrs Bates sighed. She could not approve
of her son's pride.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="small">BRANDON'S JOKE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>About quarter of a mile from the village was a pond
of small size, not over a third of a mile across, but it
provided the boys of the village a great deal of
amusement. In the summer it afforded chances
for bathing and boating, in the winter for skating.</p>

<p>Among the boys who had boats on the pond were
Dean Dunham and Brandon Bates, but there was a
considerable difference between them. Dean's was
an old flat-bottomed boat, which he had bought for
a dollar from a man who had used it for half a dozen
years, while Brandon's was spick and span new, a
very handsome craft, and by all odds the finest on
the pond.</p>

<p>Brandon was not, however, the best rower, though
he considered himself such. That distinction belonged
to Dean, whose arms were strengthened by
labor, and whose constant practice gave him unusual
skill.</p>

<p>Directly in the middle of the pond was a small
island, not over half an acre in extent, which naturally
enough was often visited by the boys of Waterford.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>On the day of Adin Dunham's journey to Rockmount,
Brandon, having nothing else to do, for there
was a vacation in the village school, sauntered down
to the place where he kept his boat. He had had a
small boat-house constructed, where he kept his boat
under cover. It had been built by Adin Dunham, the
village carpenter, and excited the admiration of the
other village boys, who did not aspire to such a luxury.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get your uncle to build you a
boat-house, Dean?" asked Brandon, satirically.</p>

<p>Dean laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"My old boat isn't likely to be injured by exposure
to the weather," he answered.</p>

<p>"That's true. How would you like to have a boat
like mine?"</p>

<p>"I should be delighted; so if you are thinking of
giving me one, I hope you will go ahead and do it."</p>

<p>Brandon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is too expensive for a working boy," he said.</p>

<p>"I know of one working boy who would appreciate
it. I suppose <i>you</i> don't call yourself a working
boy."</p>

<p>"I am a gentleman's son," said Brandon, haughtily.</p>

<p>"And gentlemen's sons don't work, I presume."</p>

<p>"They don't work for a living."</p>

<p>"There are different ways of working; working
with the brains, for instance."</p>

<p>"Of course I do that."</p>

<p>"And I, too."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't approve of a superior education for the
lower classes," remarked Brandon.</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean by the lower classes?"
asked Dean, his face flushing.</p>

<p>"Oh, working boys and working men, and so
on."</p>

<p>"Some of our most successful men used to be
working boys."</p>

<p>"A few," Brandon admitted reluctantly.</p>

<p>"I mean to become one of those few."</p>

<p>Brandon laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p>"You'd better be contented with your station in
life," he said.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the advice, but I shan't follow
it."</p>

<p>"It won't make much difference, I fancy."</p>

<p>This conversation took place three months before,
soon after Brandon's boat-house was completed.</p>

<p>When on this June day Brandon loosened his rope,
and prepared for a row, he was alone. But just as
he was pushing off he caught sight of a small boy,
ten years old, the son of a poor Irish widow in the
village, who regarded him and his boat wistfully.</p>

<p>"Give me a ride, Brandon?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Brandon would have answered in the
negative, and indeed he was on the point of doing
so, when a sudden idea entered his mind.</p>

<p>"Well, jump in, you little brat!" he said.</p>

<p>Tommy Boyle was only too glad to do so, and he
did not trouble himself to resent the rough form of
invitation.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Brandon," he said.</p>

<p>"Look here, youngster, don't call me Brandon."</p>

<p>"Why, isn't that your name?" asked Tommy, in
wonder.</p>

<p>"It is not respectful. You must call me Mr.
Bates."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Bates is your father," objected Tommy.</p>

<p>"That is my name, too. My father is Squire
Bates."</p>

<p>Tommy did not pay much attention to this explanation,
for he was paddling his hands in the water.</p>

<p>"Lemme row," said Tommy, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Let you row? You can't row."</p>

<p>"Yes I can. Dean lets me row."</p>

<p>"It doesn't make much difference about his old
tub," said Brandon, scornfully; "you can't row in
this boat."</p>

<p>"Why not, Brandon?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you not to call me Brandon?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bates, then."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll let you row when we come back.
Did you ever go to the island?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dean took me there one day."</p>

<p>"We are going there now."</p>

<p>"Are we? Cricky, ain't that fun!"</p>

<p>Brandon smiled unpleasantly, showing his teeth
after his father's fashion.</p>

<p>"He'll be singing a different tune before long," he
said to himself.</p>

<p>"When I'm a big boy I'm going to have a boat,
too," said Tommy.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps Dean will sell you his, then," suggested
Brandon, amused.</p>

<p>"He says he'll give it to me."</p>

<p>"It'll be a splendid craft, then. Is he going to do
without one?"</p>

<p>"He says he'll have a boat some time that'll beat
yours, Brandon&mdash;I mean Mr. Bates."</p>

<p>"Oh, he says that, does he?" asked Brandon,
showing his teeth again, but in a less good-natured
manner. "I should like to know where he's going
to get it from. Do you know how much this boat
cost?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It cost fifty dollars," said Brandon, in an important
tone.</p>

<p>"Is that a good deal of money?"</p>

<p>"I should say it was. It'll be years before Dean
Dunham sees as much money as that."</p>

<p>"Dean is a nice boy!" said Tommy, surmising
that his favorite was spoken of slightingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's well enough in his place, but he's a poor
working boy."</p>

<p>"My mother says he's awful good to work," asserted
Tommy.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what he's made for. But here we
are at the island. Wouldn't you like to land,
Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;Mr. Bates."</p>

<p>"All right, then! Jump out."</p>

<p>Tommy jumped out, and scrambled up the bank.
Then he turned round, expecting Brandon to follow.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>But Brandon instead pushed off from shore till his
boat rode twenty feet away. Then he turned a
laughing face towards his young passenger.</p>

<p>"Ain't you comin' too, Brandon?" asked the little
boy, in surprise.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bates."</p>

<p>"No, I'm going back."</p>

<p>"Wait for me."</p>

<p>"No, I'm going to leave you here a little while.
You'll have fine sport," and Brandon burst into a fit
of laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, take me off!" exclaimed Tommy, in dire
alarm. "I don't want to stay here."</p>

<p>"You'll be like Robinson Crusoe. You'll have a
fine time."</p>

<p>"I don't know Crusoe&mdash;I want to go home."</p>

<p>"It's the best joke I ever heard of," said Brandon,
laughing heartily. "You will be king of the island,
Tommy&mdash;King Tommy the First."</p>

<p>But Tommy did not enjoy the joke. He begged
and entreated Brandon to take him away, but the
hard-hearted boy, by way of answer, impelled his
boat vigorously, and poor Tommy, sitting down on
the bank, and digging his fists into his tear-stained
eyes, felt that he was without a friend in the world.</p>

<p>"How the little chap roars!" said Brandon, turning
with a smile to watch the forlorn cast-away.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to reach the boat-house,
where he coolly proceeded to put up his boat. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
was just hauling it on shore when Dean Dunham
made his appearance.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" he asked.</p>

<p>Brandon pointed over to the island, where poor
Tommy was still mourning his captivity.</p>

<p>"Look there!" he said.</p>




<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">TOMMY BOYLE IS RESCUED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"Who is that?" asked Dean, quickly.</p>

<p>"It is Tommy Boyle."</p>

<p>"How did he get there?"</p>

<p>"I carried him in my boat."</p>

<p>"And left him there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Brandon, with an amused laugh.</p>

<p>"Didn't he want to come back?"</p>

<p>"Of course he did. He's awfully frightened to be
left there alone. I told him he would make a good
Robinson Crusoe, but the little beggar never heard of
him."</p>

<p>"Why did you do such a mean thing, Brandon
Bates?" demanded Dean.</p>

<p>"That's my business, Dean Dunham," answered
Brandon, in an offended tone.</p>

<p>"Then I'll make it my business," said Dean,
sternly. "Get right into your boat and go after
Tommy."</p>

<p>"Why, you impudent beggar!" exclaimed Brandon,
almost foaming at the mouth with rage, "how
dare you say that to me?"</p>

<p>"There's no courage needed," said Dean, dryly.
"Are you going to do as I ask you?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I'm not," said Brandon, shortly. "Be off
with you, if you know what's best for yourself, or I
may take it into my head to thrash you."</p>

<p>"I am ready&mdash;any time, except now. I have
something else to do."</p>

<p>Brandon Bates was standing with the boat rope in
his hands, preparing to draw it into the boat-house.
He was by no means prepared for what was coming.
Dean with a quick movement snatched the rope from
him, jumped into the boat, seized the oars, and before
the owner had recovered from his astonishment, was
two lengths away, rowing in the direction of the
island.</p>

<p>"Come back here, you rascal!" exclaimed Brandon,
almost purple with rage, and stamping in his
fury.</p>

<p>"I have no time," answered Dean, coolly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by stealing my boat?"</p>

<p>"Your boat is safe, I have only borrowed it."</p>

<p>"I never saw such impudence! I will have you
arrested!"</p>

<p>"Do so if you want to. I am going to rescue the
poor little fellow you have left on the island."</p>

<p>"Then take your own boat."</p>

<p>"Tommy went over on your boat, and he's going
back on the same."</p>

<p>Brandon called out again, but Dean was now too
far away to hear him.</p>

<p>The temper of Brandon Bates was not the sweetest,
but it is doubtful whether he had ever been more
angry than at the present moment. He felt that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
dignity had been outraged, and himself insulted, and
that, too, by a working boy.</p>

<p>"I'd like to shoot him!" he vociferated, shaking his
fist in impotent rage at the rapidly-receding boat.</p>

<p>Tommy meanwhile had seen what was going on,
the distance being inconsiderable.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw that his situation was known to
Dean, the little fellow's excitement and alarm subsided.</p>

<p>"Dean will come for me, and take me home," he
said to himself.</p>

<p>When he saw Dean's bold seizure of the boat, he
clapped his hands in joy.</p>

<p>"Dean's a good deal better boy than Brandon," he
said. He rose from his place, and stood watching
eagerly for the coming of his deliverer.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Tommy!" called out Dean, when he was
within hearing distance.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Dean!"</p>

<p>"Were you very much frightened?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I thought I'd have to stay here all night."</p>

<p>Swiftly the boat sped through the water till it
grazed the pebbly shore.</p>

<p>"Jump in, Tommy!"</p>

<p>Tommy needed no second bidding.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dean, I'm so glad you came for me."</p>

<p>"And I'm glad I saw you. What made Brandon
play such a trick on you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. When I begged him to take me
back he only laughed."</p>

<p>"He doesn't look much like laughing now," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Dean, smiling, as he saw Brandon still standing at
the boat wharf, shaking his fist angrily.</p>

<p>"I hope he won't fight you, Dean," said Tommy,
rather troubled.</p>

<p>"He may if he wants to. I think he will get the
worst of it."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Brandon caught sight of the village
constable, walking along the road a few rods from
the shore of the pond.</p>

<p>He ran to the road and intercepted him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pray," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, Brandon?"</p>

<p>"I want you to arrest Dean Dunham."</p>

<p>"What am I to arrest Dean Dunham for?" asked
the constable in surprise.</p>

<p>"He took my boat from me by force, like an impudent
young loafer as he is, and is out in the boat
rowing."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see him. Tommy Boyle is with him.
How does that happen?"</p>

<p>"He went over to the island and took him off."</p>

<p>"I don't understand. How came Tommy on the
island?"</p>

<p>"I took him there."</p>

<p>"You took him there? Did he want to stay?"</p>

<p>"No, I left him there&mdash;as a joke."</p>

<p>"You left the poor little boy there to get off as he
could!" said the constable, indignantly.</p>

<p>"It didn't do him any harm," said Brandon, sullenly.
"There are no wild animals there that I ever
heard," he added sarcastically.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>"And Dean Dunham took your boat to go after
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. He took it away from me without
asking my permission."</p>

<p>"He did perfectly right. Would you have had
him leave poor Tommy there?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't he take his own boat, then?" said
Brandon in a sullen tone.</p>

<p>"Because he didn't want to leave Tommy there
any longer than was necessary. He has only done
what you ought to have done."</p>

<p>"He had no business to steal my boat. I want
him arrested."</p>

<p>"I am more likely to arrest you for kidnapping the
boy."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to know who I am, Mr. Pray,"
said Brandon angrily.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I do. You are Brandon Bates, but you
are not so important a person as you suppose."</p>

<p>"If I am not, my father is, and he'll have you
turned out of your office."</p>

<p>He expected the constable to show dismay at
this threat, but Mr. Pray, who was very independent,
only laughed.</p>

<p>"All right," he answered. "I am glad you let
me know what's going to happen. I'll see what else
I can find to do. How soon do you think I shall
lose my place?"</p>

<p>Brandon turned from the constable in disgust.
Everybody seemed to be in a conspiracy to insult
him.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>Dean was now very near shore, and Brandon's
attention was called elsewhere. The constable
remained, a little curious to witness the interview
between the two boys. Perhaps because he could not
find words to express his feelings, Brandon did not
say a word while Dean was landing his young passenger.
As he jumped out himself he held out the
rope to the angry owner.</p>

<p>"I have brought back your boat safe," he said.</p>

<p>"You'll pay for this, Dean Dunham," said Brandon,
as he took the rope with a red face.</p>

<p>"Can I help you put the boat into the boat-house?"
asked Dean calmly.</p>

<p>"I want none of your help. Never dare to touch
my boat again!"</p>

<p>"Then don't play any more such dirty tricks on
my friend Tommy! Tommy, I wouldn't advise you
to go out rowing with Brandon again."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Tommy, fervently.</p>

<p>"You won't get a chance, you dirty little brat!"
snarled Brandon.</p>

<p>"Come away, Tommy. When you want a boat
ride come to me. I'll give you a ride any time."</p>

<p>"It's a great privilege riding in your old scow,"
sneered Brandon.</p>

<p>"I don't think much of the boat myself," said
Dean, smiling. "I've seen those I liked better."</p>

<p>Dean went home, and attended to various chores.
About four o'clock that afternoon Mrs. Dunham began
to look for her husband.</p>

<p>"It's time your Uncle Adin was at home," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
said. "I suppose his business kept him longer than
he expected."</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Gould entered the yard. He looked
excited and anxious.</p>

<p>"Dean," he said, "something's happened to your
uncle. My horse just ran into my yard with the
empty buggy."</p>

<p>Dean turned pale.</p>

<p>"What shall we do? he asked.</p>

<p>"Come with me. We'll go back over the road, and
see if we can find him. Not a word to your aunt!
We don't want to make her anxious."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="small">ADIN DUNHAM RECEIVES HIS MONEY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Adin Dunham's ride to Rockmount had been uneventful.
He went at once to the real estate office
of Thomas Marks, the agent through whom the sale
had been effected. When he entered the office it
was with a light step and a joyful look, for it was on
a very agreeable errand he had come.</p>

<p>Mr. Marks was seated at his desk, and looked up
as Dunham entered.</p>

<p>"I thought you wouldn't fail to come, Mr. Dunham,"
he said with a smile. "If it were to pay
money, there might have been some question of it,
but a man doesn't generally miss an appointment to
receive a payment of a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"That's so, Mr. Marks, I've been looking forward
to this day."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt of it. I suppose such occasions
are rare with you."</p>

<p>"This is the first time I was ever lucky enough
to receive a large sum of money. I can hardly believe
I am so rich. You, see, Mr. Marks, I am a poor
man, and always have been. I inherited the place
where I live from my father, but no money to
speak of."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"Is the place clear?"</p>

<p>"No; it is mortgaged for eight hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Who holds the mortgage?"</p>

<p>"Squire Bates, of our village."</p>

<p>"I know him. He is the man with very prominent
teeth."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is he a rich man?"</p>

<p>"We all think so, but he keeps his affairs very
close."</p>

<p>"Don't the assessors know?"</p>

<p>"He says most of his property is in government
bonds, and these are not taxable, you know."</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>"I don't know how it is," said the agent, thoughtfully,
"but I don't like that man."</p>

<p>"He is always obligin' enough to me. Last time
I made him wait a week for the interest, but he did
not complain."</p>

<p>"I suppose he felt sure of getting it. How much
interest do you pay?"</p>

<p>"Seven per cent."</p>

<p>"You ought only to pay six. You will find it
hard to get more than that for your money. Shall
you pay the mortgage with the money I am to pay
you?"</p>

<p>"I did think of it, but the squire doesn't seem to
care for me to do it. He says he can find a good
investment for me."</p>

<p>"At what price do you value your house and
land?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't suppose I could get over two thousand
dollars for it."</p>

<p>"That would leave you twelve hundred after the
mortgage is paid."</p>

<p>"Yes. If I pay it off with this thousand, there
would be two hundred dollars left over."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, I think myself in great good
luck to get so much for my land here. When Uncle
Dan left it to me I didn't suppose it was worth over
two hundred dollars altogether, and I don't believe I
could have got any more. You see it is very poor
land to cultivate."</p>

<p>"True enough, but the site was commanding.
For the hotel company it is a good purchase."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is, but nobody thought of a hotel
being built at the time I inherited the land from my
uncle. Probably he thought it worth little or nothing,
for he didn't like me overmuch, and didn't care
to do much for me."</p>

<p>"Then it is better for you that he couldn't foresee
the prospective value of his bequest. It might have
led to an alteration in his will."</p>

<p>"No doubt it would. When are the hotel folks
goin' to build?"</p>

<p>"They have got the cellar dug and the frame up
already. Didn't you know that?"</p>

<p>"No; I haven't been up that way."</p>

<p>"Better go by it on your return. They would
like to have had it ready for occupation this season,
but they have begun too late for that. I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
that it may be thrown open for fall boarders if it should
be completed by the middle of August."</p>

<p>"What would Uncle Dan say if he were alive to
see it?"</p>

<p>"It would make the old man open his eyes,
beyond a doubt. Now, Mr. Dunham, how will you
receive this money? Shall I give you a check?"</p>

<p>"No; I shouldn't know what to do with a check.
I never received a check in my life," said Adin Dunham,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>All bank matters were unknown to the carpenter,
except that he had once a small deposit in a savings
bank, but he never could get rid of the fear that the
bank would break, and he finally drew it out to get
his mind at rest.</p>

<p>"A check would be safer, I think," said the agent.</p>

<p>"How can it be safer? The bank might break
before I got the money."</p>

<p>Thomas Marks smiled.</p>

<p>"From what I know of the bank this is hardly
likely, I think," he made answer. "However, I don't
presume to advise. I mean that if you should lose
the check, or have it stolen, it would not be a serious
loss."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it will be made payable to your order,
and unless indorsed by you, that is, with your signature
written on the back, it would do the finder,
or thief, no good."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to lose it, and I am not likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
meet any robbers, though my wife and Squire Bates
told me I must be careful."</p>

<p>"Squire Bates told you that, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He knows, then, that you are to receive this
money to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I told him."</p>

<p>"Did you tell any one else?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That is well. It is always best to be cautious in
such cases; though I can hardly imagine, myself,
that there could be any highway robbers in a quiet
farming town like Waterford."</p>

<p>"Just what I told my wife, Mr. Marks."</p>

<p>"Then you will take the money in bills?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, if you please."</p>

<p>The agent went to a safe on the opposite side of the
room, and opened it.</p>

<p>"That's a queer sort of a cupboard, Mr. Marks,"
said Adin Dunham.</p>

<p>The agent smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "If you are going to keep
the money in your house, you may have to buy
one."</p>

<p>"How much does it cost?"</p>

<p>"I gave a hundred and twenty-five dollars for this,"
he said.</p>

<p>Adin Dunham whistled. He had not supposed it
would cost over fifteen.</p>

<p>"I shan't buy one," he said.</p>

<p>"You had better not. You will soon be investing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the money, no doubt, so that there will be no occasion.
I would pay off the mortgage if I were you."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't seem as if I had the money at all if
I did that. Besides, the squire says he will find an
investment for me."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile I hope you won't be as foolish as
a man I was reading of the other day, living in
Vermont."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"He put a hundred dollars in an air tight stove for
safe keeping. He was afraid his wife would see it
and want to spend it if he put it in a trunk or bureau
drawer. As it turned out, he had better have taken
his wife into his confidence. Not knowing that the
stove was doing service as a bank, she kindled a fire
in it one damp day, and that was the last of the hundred
dollars."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall put the money in the stove,
though it is June," said Adin Dunham. "Besides,
my wife knows all about it, and she isn't one of the
spendin' kind."</p>

<p>"That is lucky for you. Well, here is a pile of
fifty-dollar bills&mdash;twenty of them. I will count them
before you, so that you may see they are all right,
and then you may give me a receipt."</p>

<p>So the thousand dollars were counted out, and
Adin Dunham put them into his capacious pocket,
which perhaps in its history of five years had never
contained in the aggregate so large a sum of money.</p>

<p>The carpenter breathed a deep sigh of satisfaction.
The moment he had so long anticipated had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
arrived, and he carried with him a sum which seemed
to him a fortune, all his, and all to be disposed of as
he willed. He straightened up unconsciously, for he
felt that he had become a person of importance.</p>

<p>He jumped into his buggy, and when he had
finished his errands in Rockmount, he started in the
direction of home.</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN DUNHAM FINDS HIS UNCLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Adin Dunham reached the fork in the road
from which there were two different routes to Waterford,
he halted his horse in indecision.</p>

<p>"Seems to me as if I'd rather go over the creek
road," he said to himself. "I don't know why 'tis
that I don't fancy goin' through the woods to-day.
It's a silly fancy, no doubt, for I've gone that way
hundreds of times, and I told the squire I'd go that
way, and I'll do it, or he'll think strange of it."</p>

<p>So he turned to the left instead of the right, and
continued his journey. Is it true that we have presentiments
of coming evil? This was at any rate the
case with Adin Dunham. He felt a growing uneasiness,
especially when he drew near the tract of
woods through which the road ran for nearly quarter
of a mile.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with me?" he asked, as he
wiped the perspiration from his brow. "I suppose
it must be because I have so much money with me.
I wish I had taken a check."</p>

<p>Then he tried to laugh it off, but he could not
drive away the feeling of uneasiness. Somehow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
thought of robbers would present itself to his mind.</p>

<p>"I'd give a five-dollar bill if I was safe at home,"
he said to himself.</p>

<p>He had reached the middle point of the woods,
and was beginning to breathe easier. Neither before
nor behind was any one in sight.</p>

<p>"It's all right!" he thought. "As soon as I get
through them woods I shall have nothing to worry
about."</p>

<p>But just then a noise was heard to the right, and a
tramp burst out, his features concealed by a mask,
and sprang for the horse's head.</p>

<p>"Halt there!" he exclaimed in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>Adin Dunham's tongue refused service, and with
pallid cheeks, betokening intense fear, he stared at
the apparition.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he managed to ejaculate
at last.</p>

<p>"Quick! Give me that money," hissed the stranger.</p>

<p>"What money?" asked Adin Dunham, aghast,
though he knew well enough what money was
meant.</p>

<p>"No trifling, or it will be the worse for you! Give
me the thousand dollars you have in your pocket."</p>

<p>"Are you a robber?" asked Dunham, with
blanched face.</p>

<p>"Never mind what I am! I want that money.
It will be as much as your life is worth to refuse."</p>

<p>Adin Dunham was not a brave man, but the prospect
of losing his fortune, for which he had waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
so long, made him desperate. He drew out his whip
and lashed the horse.</p>

<p>"Get up, Captain!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Then, he hardly knew how it happened, the tramp
clambered into the wagon, and pressed a handkerchief
to his mouth. He felt his senses going, but
before he lost consciousness he saw something that
startled him. The tramp opened his mouth, and he
caught sight of the long tusk-like teeth.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Squire Bates!" he ejaculated, in horror-struck
dismay.</p>

<p>Then he lost all consciousness, and knew not what
followed.</p>

<p>"Confusion!" muttered the tramp. "Why did I
open my mouth?"</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into Adin Dunham's pocket,
after stopping the horse. Then, as it would not be
safe to leave the horse under the management of a
man in a faint, he took the passive form of the
carpenter from the wagon, and laid him down under
a tree by the roadside.</p>

<p>"There! It will be supposed that he fell from
the wagon in a fit!" he said to himself, as he left
the scene.</p>

<p>This was what had happened to Adin Dunham.
How long he lay in his senseless condition cannot
be told. At length he opened his eyes, and looked
about him in a dazed way.</p>

<p>"Where is the horse and wagon?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>The horse and wagon were not to be seen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Captain had waited patiently, looking round from
time to time, and gazing in evident doubt at his
driver, whinneying a hint that they had been stopping
long enough. Probably he wondered what
was the matter with Adin Dunham, who, though
not his master, was well known to him.</p>

<p>At length the Captain decided that he must settle
the matter for himself. He started for home at an
easy pace, and arrived there at length, as we know,
very much to the surprise of Mr. Gould, and the uneasiness
of Dean Dunham. We have already related
the sequel&mdash;how Mr. Gould and Dean got into the
buggy, and, somewhat to the dissatisfaction of the
horse, started back on the road to Rockmount.</p>

<p>"I can't see what has happened to uncle," said
Dean.</p>

<p>"Does your uncle ever&mdash;drink anything strong?"
asked Mr. Gould, cautiously.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Gould, he is very temperate. He has
often cautioned me about drinking."</p>

<p>"I always thought he was temperate, Dean," said
Mr. Gould, "but I thought it just possible he might
have met some old friends in Rockmount, and ventured
upon a social glass."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he would do it."</p>

<p>"He might have got off for a minute, and the
horse taken advantage and started without him.
But that doesn't seem like the Captain. He is a very
steady, reliable horse, and isn't up to any tricks."</p>

<p>"I hope uncle wasn't taken sick, and fell from the
buggy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"Has he ever been taken that way?" asked Mr.
Gould quickly.</p>

<p>"Not that I ever heard. Aunt would know."</p>

<p>"We will ask her if we don't find him on the road.
Do you know whether your uncle had any particular
business in Rockmount to-day?"</p>

<p>"No; I didn't hear him say why he was going.
I asked him to take me, but he thought two would
be too heavy a load for the horse such a long distance."</p>

<p>"He is very considerate of the Captain, more so
than I am," said Mr. Gould, laughing. "I drove to
Rockmount with Mrs. Gould, who weighs considerably
more than you, only last week, but I couldn't
see that the horse minded it much. There's one
thing I'm sure of, your uncle wouldn't over-drive
the horse."</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't drive fast enough for me. If I
had gone, I would have asked him to let me drive."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps it's just as well that you didn't
go, Dean."</p>

<p>They reached the point where it was necessary to
decide whether to go by the creek road or through
the woods.</p>

<p>"I declare, Dean, it puzzles me to decide which
way to go."</p>

<p>"If anything happened to uncle on the creek road
somebody would be sure to pass and see him."</p>

<p>"That's a very sensible suggestion. On the woods
road, on the contrary, there are but few passengers,
and he might be overlooked. So be it! We'll go by
the woods road."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from the place where Adin Dunham was
waylaid, Dean pointed eagerly to an advancing
figure.</p>

<p>"Isn't that Uncle Adin?" he asked eagerly pointing
with his whip.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, I declare."</p>

<p>Adin Dunham was walking with his head drooping,
and seemed to drag one leg after the other in a
weary way. He did not seem at all like himself.</p>

<p>"Uncle Adin," called Dean, when they were within
hearing, "what's the matter? What has happened
to you?"</p>

<p>Adin Dunham looked up, and sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"Dean," he said hoarsely, "I've been robbed!"</p>

<p>"Robbed, neighbor Dunham?" said Mr. Gould
in surprise. "What have you been robbed of?"</p>

<p>"A thousand dollars!" answered Dunham in a
spiritless way.</p>

<p>Dean and Mr. Gould looked at each other in amazement.
The same thought came to each. That the
carpenter could have had in his possession a thousand
dollars seemed preposterous. His mind must
suddenly have gone astray.</p>

<p>"Did you say a thousand dollars, neighbor Dunham?"
asked Mr. Gould.</p>

<p>"Yes," said poor Adin, bursting into tears. "A
man sprang at me when I was riding through the
woods, jumped into the buggy and searched my
pockets. I think I must have fainted away. When
I came to the horse was gone, and I was lying under
a tree by the roadside."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>This story, though strictly correct, seemed a wild
dream to Mr. Gould and Dean.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to have a thousand dollars
with you? Was it yours?" asked Mr. Gould,
almost with a smile.</p>

<p>"I received it to-day at Rockmount, for the land I
sold the hotel people."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea who robbed you of the
money?"</p>

<p>"It was Squire Bates. I knew him by his teeth."</p>

<p>"Dean," said Mr. Gould, in a low voice, "your
uncle is as crazy as a bedbug! What can have put
such notions into his head?"</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN FINDS A CLEW.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dean was inclined to agree with his companion.
The story told by his uncle was so preposterous that
it could be explained only on the hypothesis that the
speaker's mind was unbalanced.</p>

<p>"Did you fall out of the wagon, neighbor Dunham?"
asked Mr. Gould.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I must have fainted."</p>

<p>"If you had fallen out you would have been hurt.
Are you bruised anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't feel hurt."</p>

<p>"It's queer, Dean," said Mr. Gould, with a puzzled
look. "I can't make it out."</p>

<p>"I think the robber must have taken me out of
the buggy, and set me down under the tree."</p>

<p>"After taking your thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is hard that I should lose it. I was
countin' on what I would do with it. I thought I
would pay off the mortgage on my house."</p>

<p>"Who holds the mortgage?"</p>

<p>"Squire Bates."</p>

<p>Again Dean and Mr. Gould exchanged looks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Neither put any confidence in the story told by the
victim.</p>

<p>Adin Dunham was invited to take a seat in the
buggy, Dean resigning his place and sitting behind.
So they reached home.</p>

<p>"Go in, Dean, and tell your aunt what has happened,
so that she needn't be frightened when she
sees your uncle," said Mr. Gould.</p>

<p>Dean obeyed instructions.</p>

<p>"Aunt," said Dean, "you are not to be frightened,
but uncle met with an accident. He isn't
hurt!" he added, noticing the quick look of alarm,
"but he says he has been robbed."</p>

<p>"Robbed! Has he lost the thousand dollars?"
exclaimed Mrs. Dunham in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>"Did he really have a thousand dollars?" said
Dean. "I thought he might be under a delusion."</p>

<p>"Then he says he has lost it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Heaven help us to bear this terrible blow!"
ejaculated Mrs. Dunham, sinking into a chair. "I
wish he had taken you with him."</p>

<p>"I wish so, too. I don't believe one robber
would have been a match for us both."</p>

<p>Here Adin Dunham entered the house. He looked
ten years older than when he left it in the morning,
and there was a vacant look in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Wife!" he said feebly, "it's all gone! Some
villain has robbed me of the thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"But you, Adin, were you hurt? You look sick."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>"My head doesn't feel right. I think it's the
shock."</p>

<p>"I'll get you some hot tea directly. You'll feel
better after taking it."</p>

<p>"I hope so. Oh, Sarah, I didn't expect such a
blow as this."</p>

<p>"Try not to think of it now. Get well first, and
then we'll see what we can do to find the robber."</p>

<p>"I know him now!"</p>

<p>"You know who robbed you!" said his wife,
stopping short in her surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who was it? Any one livin' round here?"</p>

<p>"It was Squire Bates."</p>

<p>A terrible suspicion entered the mind of the poor
wife. It was clear to her that her husband's mind
was unhinged. As soon as she had a chance she
went out to where Dean and Mr. Gould were standing
in the yard.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Dunham tell you who robbed him?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt," answered Dean. "He said it was
Squire Bates."</p>

<p>"He just told me so. What do you think of it,
neighbor Gould?"</p>

<p>"I think your husband is upset by his accident,"
answered Gould, cautiously. "We'll wait and see
what he says to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right."</p>

<p>"You see he fainted away, and it's likely he hasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
fairly come to. At first I thought it wasn't true
about the thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"That is true. He received it to-day from the new
hotel company for some land he sold them."</p>

<p>"It's too bad, Mrs. Dunham. I'll do my part
towards finding out the villain that robbed your poor
husband."</p>

<p>"Uncle says he knew the squire by his teeth,"
said Dean, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"They certainly are very peculiar teeth."</p>

<p>"Did you ever know anyone else having such
teeth?" asked Dean.</p>

<p>"No, except the squire's boy."</p>

<p>"Yes, Brandon's teeth are just like his father's.
But of course the thief wasn't Brandon."</p>

<p>"Look here, Dean," said Mr. Gould quickly, "I
hope you don't pay any attention to that foolish story
of your uncle. He was thinking of Squire Bates, as
he intended to pay him up the mortgage which he
holds, and he naturally pictured him with the teeth
which are his most prominent feature, so to speak.
I don't fancy the squire myself, but I think he is in
better business than disguising himself and robbing
his neighbors."</p>

<p>"No doubt you are right, Mr. Gould," said Dean;
but in spite of his words, and absurd as he admitted
the suspicion to be, he could not help dwelling upon
his uncle's story.</p>

<p>The next day Adin Dunham kept his bed. The
shock to his system was such that his strength gave
away, and the doctor was summoned.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>"Adin," said his wife, anxious to clear up her
doubts as to his sanity, "can you describe the man
that robbed you?"</p>

<p>"Why should I describe him? You know how
he looks as well as I do."</p>

<p>"How should I know, Adin?"</p>

<p>"It was Squire Bates, I tell you. You know how
he looks."</p>

<p>The poor woman went out of the room, and raised
her apron to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor Adin is clean upset!" she murmured. "It
isn't enough that he's lost his money, he must lose
his mind too. Misfortunes never come singly, as
my poor old father used to say.</p>

<p>"Dean," she continued when they were alone,
"your uncle still sticks to his story that Squire Bates
robbed him."</p>

<p>"Aunt Sarah," answered Dean gravely, "a thousand
dollars would tempt almost anybody!"</p>

<p>"Dean, you don't mean to hint that the squire
would rob anybody!"</p>

<p>"I don't know, aunt. A good many strange
things happen in the world."</p>

<p>"I begin to think you are as crazy as your uncle!"
said Mrs. Dunham almost angrily.</p>

<p>"Suppose neither of us should be crazy, aunt!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunham shook her head. She was surprised
that so sensible a boy as Dean should give credence
to the absurd delusion of her husband.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dean had come to a conclusion as to
what to do. He would visit the place where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
robbery took place&mdash;his uncle had described it so
accurately that there would be no mistaking it&mdash;and
see whether there was anything to be learned there.</p>

<p>He found an opportunity the very next afternoon.
He did not say anything to his aunt, for it would
only have excited her unduly. Besides, he thought
it very possible that he would have to return without
any information, and might be laughed at.</p>

<p>It was a considerable walk to the place indicated,
but he reached it in due time. He was afraid he
would meet some one who would ask him his object,
but it was a lonely spot, and only one team passed.
He saw it in time to dodge into the woods, and so
avoided questioning.</p>

<p>When the team had passed on he came out to the
road. He could see the exact position of the buggy
at the time it was stopped by the robber, and he
found the tree under which his uncle was placed in
an unconscious condition.</p>

<p>"I have satisfied my curiosity," he said to himself,
"but that is all. I haven't got any information."</p>

<p>Just then his sharp eyes fell upon a small bright
object on the ground about three feet from the tree.
He pounced upon it eagerly and picked it up.</p>

<p>It was a sleeve button, apparently gold. Just in
the center was a black initial letter. This letter was
B!</p>

<p>Dean's eyes lighted up.</p>

<p>"This may lead to something," he said to himself
quietly, as he slipped the button into his pocket.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="small">WHAT WAS FOUND IN THE WOOD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"B stands for Bates," said Dean to himself. "Perhaps
Uncle Adin may not be so far wrong after all.
But how strange it would be if a rich and prominent
man like Squire Bates should have stooped to such a
crime! I find it very hard to believe."</p>

<p>Dean's perplexed look gave place to one of firm
determination.</p>

<p>"I mean to look up this matter," he said resolutely,
"and if my uncle has been robbed of his little
fortune by this man, I'll bring him to justice if I
can."</p>

<p>Scarcely had this purpose been formed when he
heard the sound of wheels, and not caring to be
found by one who might ask curious questions, he
concealed himself behind a tree.</p>

<p>What was his surprise when, as the buggy stopped,
he found that its solitary occupant was the man who
had been foremost in his thoughts&mdash;Squire Bates
himself.</p>

<p>"What does he want here?" thought Dean.</p>

<p>From his post behind the tree he glanced curiously
at the new arrival, and watched what he should do.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>Squire Bates descended from the buggy, and then
walked to the very tree under which Adin Dunham
had, according to his own account, found himself lying
unconscious. Then he walked in different directions
around it, peering carefully at the ground, as
if in search of something.</p>

<p>"He's looking for the button!" thought Dean in
growing excitement.</p>

<p>Then, as if distrusting his eyes, Squire Bates put
on a pair of glasses, and once more resumed his
search. But it proved unavailing.</p>

<p>"I must have dropped it somewhere else," Dean
heard him mutter.</p>

<p>"That settles it!" thought our hero. "He means
the sleeve button without doubt. My uncle is right
after all, but," he added after a pause, "no one
would believe the story, I must wait for additional
proof. I wonder what the squire would say if he
should find me here. Would he look guilty?"</p>

<p>Upon the impulse of the moment, not stopping to
consider whether he was acting wisely or not, Dean
determined to let the squire know that he was present.
He did not care to arouse his suspicion, however,
by letting him think that he had been watched.
He therefore glided swiftly a short distance to the
right, and then, showing himself openly, advanced
towards the squire, whistling carelessly.</p>

<p>Squire Bates turned quickly at the sound, and
looked annoyed when he saw who it was that intruded
upon him.</p>

<p>"You here, Dean Dunham?" he exclaimed.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's Squire Bates," said Dean, as if surprised.
"Yes, it is I."</p>

<p>"And why do you come? It is a long walk from
your house."</p>

<p>"That's true, but it is the place where Uncle Adin
was robbed, and I thought I would come and see if
I could discover anything of the money, or anything
that belonged to him."</p>

<p>"This is the place, then? I thought it might be,"
said the squire composedly. "I am on my way to
Rockmount, and the same idea occurred to me. But
it isn't of much use. If your uncle was robbed, the
money is far away by this time."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Dean, fixing his eyes
attentively on the squire.</p>

<p>"Why, it is natural to suppose so. How is your
uncle?"</p>

<p>"I left him in bed. He was upset by the shock."</p>

<p>"How sad! In what condition was he found?"</p>

<p>"He seemed bewildered, and hardly conscious
where he was."</p>

<p>"The effect of the chloroform!" thought the squire.</p>

<p>"I have thought, Dean," he said in a confidential
tone, "that perhaps he fainted away and fell from
the buggy."</p>

<p>"But the money was missing."</p>

<p>"To be sure! Probably some tramp came along,
and finding him unconscious robbed him as he lay
powerless."</p>

<p>"I thought of that, but if he had fallen from the
buggy he would have been bruised."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>"And he was not?"</p>

<p>"There was no sign of hurt or violence, only that
he seemed upset by some shock."</p>

<p>"What account did he give of the robbery&mdash;if there
was one?" asked Squire Bates, his face expressing
keen interest.</p>

<p>"He said that a man stopped his horse, climbed
into the buggy, assaulted and robbed him."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the squire, with an expression
difficult to read. "Did he describe the person?"</p>

<p>Dean hesitated. Should he or should he not, let
Squire Bates know that he was suspected! He
decided to half reveal the secret.</p>

<p>"He thought it was some one that he knew," he
answered briefly.</p>

<p>"Any one living around here?" asked Squire Bates,
nervously.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Squire Bates, but at present I think I
would rather not tell. The party may be perfectly
innocent, and my uncle's mind may be affected."</p>

<p>"Very true! It would not be at all surprising if
that were the case. If you do care to take any one
into your confidence, please remember that I am
your uncle's friend, and might have it in my power
to help you in your search."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I will remember that. I shall probably
sometime wish to consult you about the matter."</p>

<p>There was a significance in Dean's tone that made
the lawyer uneasy, but he had self-control enough
not to show his feeling.</p>

<p>"As we are on the spot suppose we make a search,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
as each of us proposed. Did your uncle lose anything
except the money&mdash;his watch, for instance?"</p>

<p>"No, his watch was all right."</p>

<p>This had not occurred before to Dean as singular.
Now it tended to confirm him in the thought that it
might have been Squire Bates, and not some common
thief, that had robbed his uncle. The plain silver
watch, never very valuable, which Adin Dunham
had carried for twenty-five years, might have presented
a temptation to an ordinary tramp. A genteel
highwayman would not have thought it worth
his while to take it.</p>

<p>"Really that is very singular," said the squire.
"Thieves generally take whatever they find, and are
not very likely to leave a watch behind."</p>

<p>"It seems to show that the thief was no ordinary
one," said Dean.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked the lawyer
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It was a high-toned robber who wouldn't care to
be burdened with an old silver watch such as Uncle
Adin carried."</p>

<p>"True! Your remark shows penetration. I
shouldn't have thought of that. Perhaps, however,
there was another reason."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Dean, his curiosity aroused.</p>

<p>"The watch would easily have been identified, and
might have led to the apprehension of the robber."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is something in that."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dean and the squire continued their investigations.
Dean, however, merely made a show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of searching. He felt convinced that the only thing
worth discovering he had already found, but of course
he had no intention of making this known to his
companion.</p>

<p>"It would be refreshing if we could find your
uncle's lost wallet&mdash;did he carry his money in a
wallet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so."</p>

<p>"But we can hardly expect it."</p>

<p>"No, there is very little chance of it, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Ha, what is this?" exclaimed the squire, who
had wandered some little distance from the tree.</p>

<p>Dean looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, that is Uncle Adin's wallet," he said surprised.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately it is empty!" said the squire,
opening it.</p>

<p>"Yes, so it seems. Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"Just here. It is clear that the thief took the
money, and threw it away."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," answered Dean, slowly.</p>

<p>"You had better take charge of it. And now I
think I must resume my journey to Rockmount."</p>

<p>Dean sat down to think. He was puzzled by the
discovery of the wallet, for he had looked in the very
spot where it was found before the squire's arrival,
and seen nothing. It looked as if the squire had
produced it from an inner pocket, and thrown it down
before picking it up, and announced its discovery.</p>

<p>"There is something very queer about all this!"
said Dean to himself, as he walked slowly homeward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">THE SQUIRE'S BOLD STROKE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"That boy evidently suspects me," thought Renwick
Bates, contracting his forehead. "He is altogether
too smart. With the help of his uncle,
whose suspicions are already excited, he may make
me trouble. I must take a bold course, and make
the accusations look ridiculous."</p>

<p>Squire Bates kept on his way till he reached Rockmount,
and drove at once to the office of Thomas
Marks.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Squire Bates?" asked the agent
politely.</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you. I suppose you have heard
of the robbery?"</p>

<p>"To what do you allude?"</p>

<p>"Adin Dunham was stopped on his way home
yesterday, and robbed of a thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>"You don't mean it?" returned the agent. "Why
I paid him that money with my own hands."</p>

<p>"So I supposed. Why didn't you give him a
check?"</p>

<p>"He preferred the bills. Besides, as you have no
bank at Waterford, he could have done nothing with
the check."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true; I didn't think of that. But it's a
pity as it happened."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me any of the details of the robbery?"</p>

<p>"I talked with Dean Dunham, the nephew, only
this morning. I have not seen Adin himself."</p>

<p>"What does the boy say?"</p>

<p>Squire Bates repeated what he had heard from Dean,
though he might have gone more into details from
his own knowledge. This, of course, he could not
venture upon.</p>

<p>"It seems extraordinary," said Thomas Marks,
thoughtfully. "How could the robber have known
that Adin Dunham had received any money?"</p>

<p>"He might have seen him at your office."</p>

<p>"I don't pay money to every one that calls upon
me," said Marks, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, or I should call for my installment," returned
the squire jocosely. "Perhaps it might have been
some one connected with the hotel company. I suppose
they knew the money was to be called for
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"By the way, in what shape did you pay the
money?"</p>

<p>"You mean in bills of what denomination?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In fifty-dollar bills."</p>

<p>"Twenty fifties then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That information may prove important. Were
the bills all on one bank?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"No, from several. Some, I think, were silver
certificates."</p>

<p>"If this had happened in England the numbers of
the notes would have been noted."</p>

<p>"Exactly. That is one advantage the English
detectives have over ours. May I ask if you have
been retained by Adin Dunham to work out the case?"</p>

<p>"No; I haven't even seen him since the robbery,
but as he is a neighbor I naturally take an interest in
the affair. If I can do anything to ferret out the thief,
or recover the money, I will do so gladly, and it shall
cost Dunham nothing."</p>

<p>"Your words do you credit, Squire Bates," said the
agent, warmly.</p>

<p>"I think I have misjudged Bates. He is a better
man than I gave him credit for," reflected Thomas
Marks.</p>

<p>"I sympathize with the poor man heartily," continued
the squire, following up the favorable impression
which he could see that he had made. "A
thousand dollars is a fortune to him. To us, Mr.
Marks, it would not be so important."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself, squire. I am by no means a
millionaire."</p>

<p>"Nor I," rejoined Squire Bates, laughing. "The
assessors of Waterford would be glad if I were."</p>

<p>"Still I don't think you are in any danger of going
to the poor house," continued the agent.</p>

<p>"Well, no, perhaps not. But I must be getting
home. I suppose you will warn the merchants here
to look out for any fifty-dollar bills that may be
offered them."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; it is a good suggestion. I don't think, however,
that the robber will be apt to spend his money
in this neighborhood."</p>

<p>"I presume not. From all I can gather he is a
wandering tramp, who possibly only expected to get a
few dollars, and will probably be quite bewildered
when he finds what a haul he has made."</p>

<p>"I hope for poor Dunham's sake he will be found
out."</p>

<p>"Amen to that!" said Squire Bates, with a queer
smile.</p>

<p>"What a droll world it is!" soliloquized the lawyer
as he turned his horse's head towards Waterford.
"How that worthy Marks would have been astonished
if he had known that the bold and audacious
robber had been holding a conversation with him!
I must send away those fifty-dollar notes. Their
use in this neighborhood would be suicidal.</p>

<p>"I think my call upon this man Marks is a clever
stroke!" the squire complacently continued musing
to himself. "I must venture upon a still bolder,
stroke, and call upon Adin Dunham, though under the
circumstances I feel rather nervous about it. If that
young Dean were out of the way I should feel more
comfortable. It may be necessary to get rid of him,
but that can wait. I understand from my boy Brandon
that Dean treated him very disrespectfully, not
to say insolently, only yesterday. As Brandon truly
remarks, the boy is as proud as he is poor, and doesn't
know his place. A working boy occupies an humble
position, and owes deference to his superiors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
in station. I might have him arrested for taking
possession of Brandon's boat by violence, but at
present it would not be politic. Our turn will come
after a while, and then Dean Dunham must look
out!"</p>

<p>When Squire Bates reached Waterford he drove to
the house of Adin Dunham. Dean was standing in
the yard.</p>

<p>"Please hold my horse, Dean," said the squire
pleasantly, "I am going to call upon your uncle."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether he can see you, sir," said
Dean, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"At any rate I can ask. I called on Mr. Marks,
from whom your uncle received the money."</p>

<p>"Did you learn anything, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I learned that the money was paid in fifty-dollar
bills&mdash;just twenty of them. You can see that
this is important. If any one in this neighborhood
offers a fifty-dollar bill in payment for any article it
should be investigated."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Dean regarded the squire with a puzzled expression.
He seemed to take so much interest in the
matter of the robbery, to be so desirous of throwing
obstacles in the way of the thief, that Dean began
to think his suspicions unwarranted. Yet there was
his uncle's description of the robber, and again there
was the tell-tale sleeve button in his pocket.</p>

<p>"It beats me!" was Dean's conclusion. "Things
may clear up, but at present it seems particularly
foggy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"Please ask your aunt if I may see Mr. Dunham,"
said the squire. "I will tie the horse."</p>

<p>Dean went in and proffered the request, adding,
"Squire Bates has just returned from Rockmount,
where he had an interview with the man who gave
uncle the money. He says it was all in fifty-dollar
bills."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mrs. Dunham, doubtfully.
"Perhaps it may be as well to let the squire go in.
We ought to be doin' somethin' to catch the thief,
and the squire's a lawyer."</p>

<p>So it happened that without notification to Dunham
she entered the sick room followed by the
squire.</p>

<p>"Adin, I've brought Squire Bates to see you," she
said soothingly.</p>

<p>Instantly Dunham became excited and manifested
alarm.</p>

<p>"Take him away!" he cried, apparently warding
off an attack with his hands. "He is the man that
robbed me!"</p>

<p>The squire was prepared for this, and he had
decided what to do.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed in a tone of concern, "is
poor Dunham's mind affected?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I fear the shock was too much for him,"
said Mrs. Dunham, sorrowfully. "What in the world
should have put such an idea into his head?"</p>

<p>"I tell you he is the man that robbed me!" exclaimed
Adin Dunham. "I know him by those
long teeth. Give me back my thousand dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Squire Bates!" he continued piteously. "They were
all I had."</p>

<p>"Poor man! I am inexpressibly shocked. I see
that my presence excites him, and I will go."</p>

<p>"I hope you will excuse his words, squire. He
doesn't know what he says."</p>

<p>"Yes, he does, and he means it too. That man
knew I was to bring back a large sum of money,
and he lay in wait for me."</p>

<p>"I had better go, I think," said the squire nervously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunham followed him from the room, continuing
her apologies.</p>

<p>"Don't say a word, my dear madam," said the
squire in a sympathetic tone. "I feel for you, indeed
I do. To prove it, I will head a subscription
to make up to your husband a part of his loss. I
will put down fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Squire Bates. How can I
thank you?"</p>

<p>"Don't thank me at all, but rest assured that I will
do all I can for Mr. Dunham, notwithstanding his
strange delusion respecting myself."</p>

<p>"That's clever stroke number two," thought the
squire, as he rode homeward. "I think I have thoroughly
disarmed suspicion now."</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">THE MISSING SLEEVE BUTTON.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Squire Bates was as good as his word. He drew
up a subscription paper, and headed it with a subscription
of fifty dollars, and went through the village
with it. At the end of three days he came again
to Adin Dunham's plain home, and handed Mrs.
Dunham a hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>"It won't make up your husband's loss," he said,
"but it is better than nothing. I wish I could afford
to give more myself."</p>

<p>"How kind you are, Squire Bates!" said Mrs.
Dunham, weeping softly. "God has indeed raised
up a friend for us in our time of trouble."</p>

<p>"Don't make too much of my poor service, Mrs.
Dunham," said the squire modestly. "It is a great
deal easier for me to give fifty dollars than for your
husband to lose a thousand."</p>

<p>"True; but you are very kind, all the same."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Dunham told Adin what the squire had
done, he kept silence for a moment, and was obviously
perplexed.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," he murmured.</p>

<p>"I hope, now, Adin, you will give up the ridiculous
idea that the squire robbed you," said his wife.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't," said Adin. "I saw him with these very
eyes. I saw those long teeth of his just as plain as
I see you this minute. It's very queer. I can't understand
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Adin! I did hope you would get this out
of your head. It almost seems as if your mind was
upset."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is, but I can't give up the idea that
the squire took my thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"It stands to reason, Adin, that if he had, he
wouldn't have taken all this trouble to raise money
for you. Why, he gave fifty dollars out of his own
pocket."</p>

<p>"Did fifty dollars of this money come from the
squire?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just look at his name on the paper. His
name is the very first one on it."</p>

<p>"Then," said Adin Dunham, carefully counting
out fifty dollars from the roll of bills which had been
placed in his hand, "I'll give back the money to
you to do what you like with. The other money
came from my friends and neighbors, and I'll keep
it. But the squire's money I don't want."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are very obstinate, Adin. Why
shouldn't the squire's money be as good as anybody's?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to put myself under any obligations
to him," said Adin, stiffly.</p>

<p>"You are willin' I should keep the money?"</p>

<p>"Do as you please, Sarah. Only don't let me
hear any more of it."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah Dunham put the fifty dollars carefully aside.
It seemed strange to her to have so much money in
her individual possession. She felt grateful to the
squire, if Adin did not.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, and Adin Dunham was able to go
about his work. But he seemed a changed man.
All his ambition and energy seemed to be gone. He
was no longer able to do as much work as formerly,
and he went about the place in a listless manner,
which made Dean and his aunt feel anxious. Whenever
he caught sight of the squire he hurried away,
apparently anxious to avoid him.</p>

<p>Renwick Bates did not appear to take any notice
of this silence, but it disturbed him.</p>

<p>"He hasn't got over the thought that I robbed
him," he said to himself. "Why was I furnished
with these wretched tusks? If I had teeth like other
people, I should not have been identified. There's
one good thing, nobody is likely to share his suspicion.
That subscription paper and my large
contribution have completely blinded the eyes of
people. If he persists in his charge, he will only
convince his neighbors that he is a fit subject for an
insane asylum."</p>

<p>There was one, however, who fully believed his
uncle's story, and that was Dean, who also avoided
the squire when it was in his power to do so. He
still had in his possession the sleeve button that he
had found in the wood, but he had not yet shown it
to any one. He was considering what to do about
it. He had no doubt about its being the property of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Squire Bates, and finally he determined to put it to
the proof by letting Brandon see it accidentally.</p>

<p>He waited for a favorable opportunity. One day
when the boys were at recess, and Brandon standing
only three feet distant, he plunged his hand into his
pocket, and drew out three pennies and the tell-tale
sleeve button, showing it so plainly that Brandon
couldn't help seeing it.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that button?" asked Brandon
sharply.</p>

<p>"What button?"</p>

<p>"The sleeve button marked 'B.'"</p>

<p>"I found it," answered Dean composedly.</p>

<p>"Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"Why do you feel so much interest in it?" demanded
Dean. "I don't know that I am called upon
to tell you where I found it."</p>

<p>"I believe you stole it!" said Brandon.</p>

<p>"Say that again, Brandon Bates, and I'll knock you
over!" retorted Dean with spirit. "Do you mean to
insult me?"</p>

<p>"I have a right to say what I did. That sleeve
button belongs to my father."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?" asked Dean, his face lighting
up, for he had made the discovery he desired.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure of it. I have seen the button
plenty of times. Besides, you know B stands for
Bates."</p>

<p>"It also stands for Bunting," answered Dean.
"How do I know but it was lost by Sam Bunting?"</p>

<p>Sam Bunting was a poor, ragged, half-witted fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
who was the good-natured butt of the village people.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to joke about, Dean Dunham,"
said Brandon angrily. "I tell you the sleeve button
belongs to my father. Give it to me right away!"</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute! Don't be so impatient. Has
your father mentioned losing a sleeve button?"</p>

<p>"No," Brandon was compelled to admit.</p>

<p>"Then you may be mistaken."</p>

<p>"I know I can't be mistaken. Haven't I seen the
sleeve button plenty of times?"</p>

<p>"Very likely, but it may belong to some one else,
after all."</p>

<p>"Did you pick up the other also?" asked Brandon.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where did you pick it up?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it necessary to tell you."</p>

<p>"You will have to tell my father."</p>

<p>"That is just what I am willing to do. If you
will find out whether your father has lost such a button,
and will let me know, I will go and see him
about it, and answer any questions he may choose to
ask about where I found it."</p>

<p>"It will be just the same if you give it to me."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Brandon, but I prefer to surrender it
to your father."</p>

<p>"That's fair enough, Brandon," said a boy who
had listened to this conversation.</p>

<p>"I suppose Dean wants to sell it for old gold," said
Brandon insolently.</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble yourself about supposing,"
said Dean coolly. "If I find the sleeve button belongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
to your father, I shall be perfectly willing to give it up
to him."</p>

<p>"Because you will have to."</p>

<p>"Put it that way if you want to. I don't care to
keep what doesn't belong to me."</p>

<p>"How long have you had the sleeve button?"</p>

<p>"About a week."</p>

<p>When Brandon went home from school he lost no
time in reporting the matter to his father.</p>

<p>"Papa," he said, "Dean Dunham's got a sleeve
button of yours."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Squire Bates nervously.</p>

<p>"One of the sleeve buttons marked 'B.' Did you
know you had lost one of them?"</p>

<p>"No. So&mdash;the Dunham boy has got it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he showed it to me at recess."</p>

<p>"Where did he say he got it?" asked Squire Bates,
with a disturbed look.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't tell me. I asked him, but he said
he wouldn't tell any one but you; and, though I told
him I knew it was yours, he wouldn't give it to me."</p>

<p>"The boy did right," said Squire Bates, recovering
his self-possession. "Perhaps it isn't mine."</p>

<p>"But I know it is yours, papa!" persisted Brandon.</p>

<p>"Very well! You may ask Dean Dunham to bring
it to me. I can soon decide that point."</p>

<p>"This is awkward!" said the squire to himself, as
he paced the room after Brandon had left his presence.
"I can guess where the boy found the button.
I must put him off the track by as plausible
an explanation as I can devise."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN RECEIVES A GIFT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>My father says you are to call with the sleeve button,
Dean Dunham, said Brandon Bates, in an imperious
tone.</p>

<p>"Very well; I shall be happy to oblige him," answered
Dean, with a smile. "I will call this evening
if you think he will be at home."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will be at home. And, I say, you'd
better tell him the truth."</p>

<p>"I always do. I judge from your caution that
you don't."</p>

<p>"If you're going to talk to me, Dean Dunham,"
said Brandon, scowling, "you'd better be respectful."</p>

<p>"Then you must deserve my respect."</p>

<p>The colloquy was interrupted by the ringing of the
school bell.</p>

<p>That evening Brandon Bates watched for the coming
of Dean, being curious to learn where it was that
he had found the sleeve button. He accompanied
Dean into his father's private room, where Squire
Bates was sitting at a writing-desk.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"Here's Dean Dunham, papa!" he said.</p>

<p>"Very well, Brandon, you may withdraw, and
leave Dean alone with me."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I stay, papa?" asked Brandon, his face
elongating with the disappointment he felt at the unexpected
exclusion.</p>

<p>"No, it is not necessary, my son."</p>

<p>Brandon went out sulkily, and installed himself at
the door with his ear at the keyhole. But he was decidedly
nonplussed when Squire Bates, moving softly
to the door, opened it unexpectedly, and he nearly
tumbled in.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you to leave?" demanded his father,
sternly.</p>

<p>"I'm going," answered Brandon, in a shamefaced
manner.</p>

<p>"How is your uncle, Dean?" asked Squire Bates,
resuming his seat at the desk.</p>

<p>"Not very well, Squire Bates. He hasn't been
himself since the robbery."</p>

<p>"Oh, ah! Yes. It was, no doubt, quite a shock
to him. Let us hope he will soon be himself
again."</p>

<p>"I don't think he will be himself till he recovers
the money."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have not learned anything about
it as yet."</p>

<p>"Well, we have a clew," said Dean, slowly.</p>

<p>"What sort of a clew?" asked the squire, nervously.</p>

<p>"Well, not enough to speak of yet."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>"By the way," continued the squire, carelessly,
"Brandon tells me you have found a sleeve button
which he thinks belongs to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, would you like to see it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you have it with you."</p>

<p>Dean produced from his vest pocket the button
already referred to.</p>

<p>"Is it yours?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"It looks very much like one I once owned," said
the squire, taking it in his hand. "Did you find the
mate to it?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Dean, in surprise. "Is the other
button lost also?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Squire Bates. "By the by, where did
you find it?"</p>

<p>"Only a few feet from the spot where my uncle
was robbed&mdash;in the woods," answered Dean, scrutinizing
the face of the lawyer closely as he spoke.
But Squire Bates was prepared for this disclosure,
and betrayed neither surprise nor confusion.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he said. "This is most interesting.
When did you find it?"</p>

<p>"On the day afterwards."</p>

<p>"It must have been dropped by the person who
robbed your uncle, then?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I thought," said Dean, much
surprised by this apparent confession on the part of
the squire.</p>

<p>"I must now tell you that the sleeve buttons, with
a small sum of money, mysteriously disappeared
about that time," the squire continued, in a confidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
manner. "I am inclined to attribute their loss
to a tramp who was seen prowling round my house
the day before your uncle's misfortune. It looks as
if both robberies were by the same person."</p>

<p>Dean stared at the squire in amazement. He had
not foreseen this crafty explanation, and though he
utterly disbelieved in its truth, he saw no way of discrediting
it. The bomb which he anticipated exploding
to the squire's utter confusion in the light of this
statement appeared a very innocent and harmless one
indeed. He kept silent, but the cunning squire with
pleasure noted his discomfiture.</p>

<p>Dean was almost inclined to ask himself if this
could be the real explanation when the thought of his
uncle's description of the robber occurred to him.
But on this point he did not think it would do any
good at present to speak.</p>

<p>"I wish," added the squire with a smile, "you had
found both the sleeve buttons, as I would in that case
have asked your acceptance of them."</p>

<p>"They are marked B," objected Dean.</p>

<p>"True; I did not think of that. Let me then ask
your acceptance of a small reward," and Squire Bates
drew from his pocket a silver dollar.</p>

<p>But Dean shrank back. He was convinced in spite
of all that Squire Bates was the robber of Adin Dunham,
and he didn't feel willing to accept any favor
at his hands.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he answered, "but I don't care to
make money."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have all the money you want," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the squire, with a sneer which he did not quite succeed
in repressing.</p>

<p>"Money is very scarce with all of us, Squire Bates,"
said Dean, gravely, "but I would rather earn what I
get. If you will give me the button I will accept it."</p>

<p>"What good will it do you?" demanded the Squire,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Probably none at all. But if this tramp should
be found, and proved to have the other button, it
would be good evidence against him, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Just so!" said the squire, after a pause. "Well,
you may keep it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"I won't detain you any longer, if you wish to go,"
continued the squire, politely. "Perhaps you would
like to remain awhile with Brandon."</p>

<p>"If Brandon invites me to stay I will do so," answered
Dean.</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>Dean left the room, and out in the yard he found
Brandon, awaiting his appearance with evident curiosity.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "did pa haul you over the
coals?"</p>

<p>"Why should he? I did him a favor, didn't I, in
finding his sleeve button?"</p>

<p>"Then he said it was his?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did he ask you why you didn't bring it to him
before?"</p>

<p>"No, he treated me with great politeness, and
asked me to accept the sleeve button."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Dean repeated his statement.</p>

<p>"But if you keep this the other won't be any good
to him."</p>

<p>"He says both sleeve buttons were stolen from
him the day before my uncle's robbery by a tramp&mdash;that
is, he thinks it was a tramp."</p>

<p>"Jehu! That's the first I ever heard of it," said
Brandon, in great surprise.</p>

<p>"Just as I thought," said Dean to himself. "Your
father can probably give you all the particulars," he
added aloud.</p>

<p>"But you haven't told me where you found it,
Dean."</p>

<p>"Your father can tell you that too."</p>

<p>"What a stiff, disobliging boy you are!" exclaimed
Brandon, angrily. "Why can't you tell me yourself?"</p>

<p>"I think your father would prefer to tell you himself."</p>

<p>"Dean you can't want that button. I'll give you
twenty-five cents for it."</p>

<p>"I never give away gifts," returned Dean.</p>

<p>When Brandon later on plied his father with questions
the latter declined to gratify his curiosity.</p>

<p>"But why did you give Dean the sleeve button,
papa?"</p>

<p>"As a reward for his honesty. There, I'm tired of
the whole subject, and prefer to drop it."</p>

<p>"I wish you had given me the sleeve button."</p>

<p>"I'll buy you a new pair when I go to Philadelphia.
Will that do?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>Brandon was very well pleased with this promise,
and dropped the subject.</p>

<p>When all the family had retired, Squire Bates took
from a secret drawer in his desk the mate of the
missing sleeve button&mdash;its counterpart in every particular.</p>

<p>"I must get rid of this," he said. "In connection
with that boy's story its discovery in my possession
would be a damaging piece of evidence."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN'S NEW PLANS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning Squire Bates rose half an hour
before breakfast, and took a walk in the garden behind
the house. He had his cane with him, which
was unusual, as he was not leaving his own grounds.
He proceeded to the lower end of the garden, and
then, thrusting the point of the cane into the soft loam,
made in this way a round hole, perhaps eight inches
deep, into which he carefully dropped the solitary
sleeve button, and then filled up the hole again.</p>

<p>"There," said he to himself in a tone of satisfaction,
"that disposes of the button. Now Dean Dunham
can say what he likes, he can't throw suspicion
on me."</p>

<p>As he re-entered the house he met Brandon just
coming downstairs.</p>

<p>"You're up early, papa," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was tired of the bed and got up a few minutes
earlier than usual."</p>

<p>"Have you been out?"</p>

<p>"Only walking in the garden a few minutes."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't you got a mortgage on Adin Dunham's
place?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Suppose he doesn't pay up?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he is able to pay up."</p>

<p>"Can't you foreclose the mortgage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I shouldn't like to worry the old man&mdash;at
present."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of Dean. He don't treat me with
any respect. He doesn't seem to know that you could
turn the whole family out of doors."</p>

<p>"You don't like Dean, I infer."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Brandon, bluntly.</p>

<p>"He is rather independent for a boy in his circumstances,"
said the squire, slowly. "Sometime he
may regret it."</p>

<p>Squire Bates raised his eyebrows slightly, and his
words conveyed a vague threat.</p>

<p>"However," he added, "he may become more
sensible, and understand his position better. Let us
hope he will."</p>

<p>Brandon was not slow in communicating what had
been said to Dean. The next time they had a difference
he said: "You'd better keep good friends
with me, Dean Dunham."</p>

<p>"Why," asked Dean, struck by his tone.</p>

<p>"Because my father's got a mortgage on your uncle's
place, and I may get him to turn you all out
into the street."</p>

<p>"Has he any idea of doing it?" asked Dean,
quickly.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"Not if you behave yourself&mdash;that is, not at present."</p>

<p>"Thank you! You are very kind to give me
warning."</p>

<p>In the evening Dean spoke to his uncle about the
matter.</p>

<p>"Uncle Adin," he said, "Squire Bates holds a
mortgage on this place, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dean," answered his uncle, sadly.</p>

<p>"For how much?"</p>

<p>"Eight hundred dollars. I meant to pay off the
mortgage with the thousand dollars that I was robbed
of. I always feel uneasy when I think of our home
being at the mercy of any one, no matter who it is."</p>

<p>"Do you think the squire wants you to pay up
the mortgage?"</p>

<p>"No; he said he was satisfied to have it remain,
as it paid fair interest."</p>

<p>"Brandon Bates let drop a hint that his father
might call it in, if I didn't treat him with more
respect."</p>

<p>"Is there any quarrel between you two boys?"
asked Adin, somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well, we don't agree very well. He wants me
to bow down before him, and I don't mean to do it."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't quarrel seriously, Dean. His
father holds me in his power, and it's best to keep
on good terms with him."</p>

<p>"Uncle Adin, I wish you had been able to pay up
that mortgage," said Dean, earnestly. "I don't like
the squire much better than his son."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid there is no hope of it now, Dean,"
said Adin Dunham, sighing, "unless I can get my
lost money back."</p>

<p>"Uncle Adin, I want to help you pay the mortgage,
and for that reason I want you to let me leave
home."</p>

<p>"What have you got in your head, Dean? What
good will it do to leave home?"</p>

<p>"I can earn some money. Here in Waterford
there is no chance for a boy like me to get hold of
any."</p>

<p>"It's a risky thing for a boy as young as you to
start for himself, Dean. Besides there's John Roberts,
the shoemaker, will take you into his shop
and teach you the business. He told me last week
he'd give you three dollars a week."</p>

<p>"I want to earn money faster than that, uncle.
It would take all that to pay my expenses."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do, Dean?"</p>

<p>"To let me leave home if a good chance offers."</p>

<p>"I'll see about it, Dean; but I'm afraid you're
miscalculatin' your strength."</p>

<p>"Thank you, uncle, other boys have succeeded,
and I think I can."</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards, Brandon said to his father,
"What do you think Dean Dunham says?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I can't imagine," answered the squire,
with a shade of uneasiness. He feared that Dean
might have been speaking out his suspicions in relation
to the robbery of his uncle.</p>

<p>"He says his uncle has consented to let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
leave home if a good job offers. He wants to go
out into the world to seek his fortune."</p>

<p>"It might not be a bad idea," said Bates.</p>

<p>"I don't think he'd meet with any success,"
said Brandon, sharply. "He thinks he is awful
smart, and would come home with a fortune in six
months."</p>

<p>"Boys are apt to be sanguine," said his father,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to have me leave home to
seek my fortune?"</p>

<p>"No; but your case is different. Dean's uncle is
a poor man."</p>

<p>"I suppose he could black boots for a living in
some large place."</p>

<p>"Well, bootblacks sometimes make very good
pay."</p>

<p>"You seem to be in favor of Dean's going away,
papa?"</p>

<p>"I feel no particular interest in the matter. I confess
I don't like the boy, but for his uncle's sake I
hope he may do well. And, now, Brandon, I must
ask you to leave me, as I have some letters to
write."</p>

<p>"That will be a good solution of the difficulty,"
soliloquized Renwick Bates, when he found himself
alone. "The boy evidently suspects me, and I
should like to get him out of the way. Some accident
might happen to him, or he might get into some
scrape. At any rate, his plan chimes in with my
own wishes, and if I have an opportunity I will help
him to leave Waterford."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later, as Dean was walking home from
the village store with a small basket of groceries, he
met a stranger&mdash;a man with very dark hair and a
sallow complexion. He was of medium size, and
had a cast in one eye which gave a sinister expression
to his face.</p>

<p>"I suppose you live in the village, boy?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you can direct me to the house of
Renwick Bates."</p>

<p>"Squire Bates?"</p>

<p>"Is that what you call him?" asked the stranger,
with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I will conduct you to his house, if
you wish."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I wish you would."</p>

<p>Dean had to go out of his way a short distance,
but, being of an obliging disposition, he did so willingly.</p>

<p>"That is the house, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I haven't any change, or I would
pay you for your trouble."</p>

<p>"It is quite unnecessary," said Dean, hastily. "I
don't care for any pay."</p>

<p>"Well, thank you, then."</p>

<p>"I wonder who that is," thought Dean. "I don't
like his looks much, and I wish he hadn't offered me
pay for guiding him. He doesn't seem to have been
here before."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>As the stranger turned into the front yard, he saw
Brandon, sitting on the bank, whistling.</p>

<p>"I don't need to ask whose son you are," said the
stranger, smiling.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Brandon, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Those teeth are unmistakable, my young friend."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to insult me? Who are you, any
way?" asked Brandon, imperiously.</p>

<p>"A friend of your father's who won't stand any
impudence!" said the stranger, sharply. "Go into
the house and tell him that Peter Kirby wishes to see
him."</p>

<p>Cowed by the stranger's manner, Brandon sulkily
obeyed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="small">PETER KIRBY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If Brandon had supposed the stranger would prove
an unwelcome visitor to his father, he would have
been undeceived if he could have been present at the
interview between them.</p>

<p>"What, Kirby!" said the squire, as the new arrival
entered his study.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I, captain," answered Peter Kirby, sinking
into an arm-chair. "You seem comfortably
fixed here."</p>

<p>"Yes; I have tried to make myself comfortable."</p>

<p>"And I understand you go by the name of
squire?"</p>

<p>"How did you learn that?"</p>

<p>"From a boy who guided me here."</p>

<p>"I hope you did not express any surprise."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I did nothing to arouse suspicion. Are
you a justice of the peace?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And perhaps preside over trials?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sometimes."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" demanded the
squire irritably.</p>

<p>"It is a good joke. Suppose the good people
here were acquainted with your real character?"</p>

<p>"Hush; this is no time for jesting. You might
be overheard. Now, what news?"</p>

<p>"Well, there isn't much. Things have been pretty
quiet. You haven't been at any of our meetings
lately?"</p>

<p>"No; I did not care to excite suspicion. I've
been engaged in a little enterprise on my own
account."</p>

<p>"What, here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Kirby with interest.</p>

<p>"I learned that one of my neighbors&mdash;a simple
minded carpenter&mdash;was to receive a considerable sum
of money, which I had reason to think he would
bring home in person. I disguised myself, lay in
wait for him, and took the whole."</p>

<p>"How much was there?"</p>

<p>"A thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>"Excellent! And you have it here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It happened to be in fifty-dollar bills, and
I have not dared to use any of it lest it should be
traced to me. Besides, there is one who suspects
me of having been implicated in the affair?"</p>

<p>"Is it a person likely to prove dangerous?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It is a boy."</p>

<p>"A boy! How should a boy be likely to suspect
you?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tell you. It is a nephew of the man who
lost the money. Near the scene of the robbery he
found a sleeve button marked with my initial, which
I had the ill luck to drop."</p>

<p>"Does he know it is yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son recognized it in his possession, and
unfortunately let out that it was mine. I at once
sent for the boy, asked to see the button, and admitted
it was mine."</p>

<p>"How then did you explain?"</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. I told him that both buttons
had been stolen from me, probably by a tramp
who had been seen prowling round my house, and
that I presumed the same man had robbed his
uncle."</p>

<p>"Very ingenious, upon my word! You always
were a man of ideas, captain. I suppose this
allayed his suspicions."</p>

<p>"Not wholly, though it puzzled him. I must tell
you that while I was relieving the uncle of his money,
though otherwise disguised I unfortunately opened
my mouth."</p>

<p>"And showed your teeth?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. I have often had occasion to regret
that Nature supplied me with such ugly looking tusks,
for they are a dangerous means of identification. I
understand the carpenter&mdash;one Adin Dunham&mdash;has
spoken of this, but it seemed absurd to those who
heard him that a man in my position should be a robber,
and it was taken as a proof that he was out of
his head. I strengthened this impression by taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
a foremost part in raising a subscription for the carpenter
to compensate him partially for his loss, and
myself contributed fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"Out of the man's own money?" asked Kirby
laughing.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't venture to use one of the fifty dollars.
I used other money which I had."</p>

<p>"Then you have the money by you still?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Squire Bates rose from his seat, locked the door,
and then opening a small cabinet drew out a roll of
bills&mdash;which he counted before his visitor.</p>

<p>"See," he said, "Here are twenty bills, amounting
in all to a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Peter Kirby's eyes brightened covetously as he
eyed this large sum of money.</p>

<p>"It was a good haul for one man to make, in a
quiet place like this," he said.</p>

<p>"So I flatter myself," said Squire Bates complacently.</p>

<p>"But I can't help expressing my surprise at your
burying yourself in such a small, out of the way
place. If you were in one of our large cities, for
instance, it would be much more convenient, and
the rest of the band could communicate with you
better."</p>

<p>Squire Bates rose and paced the room thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"That is true," he said, after a pause, "but you
must remember also that I should stand a better
chance of being recognized in a large and important
place, where there is a well disciplined and efficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
police force and an organized body of detectives.
No one would think of looking for me in a small, unimportant
village like Waterford, where I pass as the
village lawyer, and have a commission as justice of
the peace."</p>

<p>"How do you sustain the part of a lawyer?"</p>

<p>"I have a few law books, and there was a time in
earlier years&mdash;I think I was nineteen&mdash;when I passed
six months in the office of a lawyer, where I picked
up some of the rudiments of practical jurisprudence."</p>

<p>"Where was that?"</p>

<p>"In a Western town, not far from Chicago. Here
no very complicated matters come before me. I am
perfectly competent to draft a will, to write out a
deed, make out a lease, and so on&mdash;that is all that
is required of me."</p>

<p>"You must find it very dull living here. I couldn't
stand it."</p>

<p>"I must live somewhere, and you must remember
that I have a wife and son who are entirely ignorant
of my real character."</p>

<p>"They suppose you to be a lawyer?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I saw your son outside. It was easy to recognize
him as your son."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Peter Kirby touched his teeth with a significant
gesture.</p>

<p>"He has your teeth," he said. "They are a perfect
<i>facsimile</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the squire soberly. "He too is cursed
with this deformity."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"Still, as teeth, I have no doubt they are strong and&mdash;durable."</p>

<p>"Yes, they will last me all my life. I have no excuse
for having them extracted, and procuring an
artificial set. Yet I want to do it, if I were not a
coward as regards dentists. But, to come back to
business. I shall hand you these bills, and ask you
to exchange them for bills of other denominations.
You can send them to me in an express package."</p>

<p>"There will be some risk about this, won't there,
as it is known that the stolen money was in fifty-dollar
bills?"</p>

<p>"Not if you go far enough away. I shall want
you to go to Chicago on other business which I will
communicate to you. There you will have no difficulty
in effecting the change."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am to have a commission?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you can retain fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"That is small, captain," said Kirby, in a tone of
discontent.</p>

<p>"It may be, but I have other work for you to do
which will increase your remunerations."</p>

<p>"What sort of work?"</p>

<p>"I have already told you of a boy in the village
who suspects me of being implicated in the robbery."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I mean you to take him with you."</p>

<p>"What, and to abduct him? That will be difficult
and dangerous."</p>

<p>"No, you are to offer him lucrative employment,
and he will go with you willingly. Then you are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
get him into trouble, involve him in a crime perhaps,
and he won't dare to come back. I learn from Brandon
that he is anxious to obtain a position. However,
I will give you detailed instructions how to proceed."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN IS ENGAGED AS PRIVATE SECRETARY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"Brandon," said his father, "I would like to have
you call at Adin Dunham's with a note."</p>

<p>Brandon frowned. He did not fancy being employed
as an errand boy.</p>

<p>"Can't you get somebody else?" he asked. "I
wouldn't mind going to any other place, but I don't
like to go there on an errand."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that will overcome your objections,"
said his father, producing a silver dollar.</p>

<p>"Thank you, papa, I'll go," said Brandon with
alacrity, for he was always in want of money.
"Who is the note for?"</p>

<p>"For the boy&mdash;Dean."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Brandon's face changed.</p>

<p>"Seems to me Dean Dunham is getting to be
a person of a good deal of importance," he said.
"What is the note about? If you are going to haul
him over the coals I won't mind taking it."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Mr. Kirby, our guest, is going
to offer him a position as his clerk and private secretary."</p>

<p>"And did you recommend him to Mr. Kirby?"
asked Brandon, considerably disgusted.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>Squire Bates was sharp enough to understand the
cause of Brandon's dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you confidentially," he said
with a smile, "that I don't envy the boy who works
for Peter Kirby."</p>

<p>"Then it isn't such a great chance after all?"</p>

<p>"I suspect that Dean will be sorry he engaged to
work for him within a week. But of course you
won't let drop a word to prejudice the boy against
accepting Mr. Kirby's offer."</p>

<p>"You may rely upon me, papa," said Brandon
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Dean was reading aloud to his uncle when there
was a knock at the door, which was answered by
Mrs. Dunham.</p>

<p>"Brandon Bates!" she said in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Dunham. Is Dean at home?"</p>

<p>"Won't you come in? Yes, he's at home."</p>

<p>"I won't stop. I should like to see him a minute."</p>

<p>"Dean, here's Brandon Bates wants to see you a
minute," said his aunt.</p>

<p>Dean shared in Mrs. Dunham's surprise. He
laid down the paper from which he was reading, and
went to the door.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Brandon!" he said politely, "do
you wish to see me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I've got a note for you. I happened to
be coming this way, and I told my father I'd take
it," continued Brandon, anxious to have it understood
that he was not specially sent to the cottage.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Brandon. Won't you come in while
I am reading it?"</p>

<p>"No, but I'll wait. I think it's short." Dean tore
open the envelope, and read as follows in the handwriting
of Squire Bates:</p>


<p class="sigleft p2t">"<span class="smcap">Dean Dunham</span>:</p>

<p>"I understand from my son Brandon that you are
seeking employment, and have no objection to leave
home. A gentleman at present visiting me is in
want of a clerk and secretary, and he would like to
have an interview with you. As he leaves town
to-morrow, I send for you this evening.</p>

<p class="sigright p2b">"<span class="smcap">Renwick Bates.</span>"</p>


<p>Dean felt that nothing would suit him better.</p>

<p>He felt grateful to Squire Bates for what he regarded
as a piece of unexpected kindness.</p>

<p>"Your father is very kind, Brandon," he said as
he folded up the note. "He offers me a position
with a friend of his."</p>

<p>"He just mentioned the matter to me," Brandon
said indifferently.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the gentleman is one to whom I
showed the way to your father's house this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Like as not. I don't know him; I never saw
him before."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know whether he lives far from
here or not?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder whether I shall suit him," queried Dean
anxiously.</p>

<p>"My father seems to think you will," answered
Brandon. "Of course I don't know anything about
it."</p>

<p>"I will try to suit him at any rate," said Dean
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Do you think your uncle will let you go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a fair chance. I've talked over the matter
with him and he sees that there isn't anything for
me to do in Waterford, and that I shall have to leave
town to get a place that is worth having."</p>

<p>"I shall envy you for one thing," said Brandon.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Because you will be leaving Waterford."</p>

<p>"It is a pretty village."</p>

<p>"I am sick and tired of it. There is nothing
going on here. I don't see why a gentleman of my
father's wealth should bury himself in such a one-horse
place."</p>

<p>"It isn't very lively," Dean admitted.</p>

<p>"I should say not. Why even the circus doesn't
come any nearer than ten miles. I shall tease papa
to go to New York to live. I should like to live on
Madison or Fifth Avenue."</p>

<p>Dean knew very little about either of the avenues
referred to, though he had heard of them as tenanted
by rich families. He rather congratulated himself
that Brandon had not sought the place which was to
be offered to him.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the home of Squire
Bates, and Dean followed Brandon into the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
He soon found himself in the presence of the squire
and of Peter Kirby.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Dean," said the squire pleasantly.
"This is my friend, Mr. Kirby.</p>

<p>"I have seen the young man before," said Kirby,
opening his mouth in what he tried to make a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I remember you."</p>

<p>Looking at Kirby as his future employer, Dean
was not prepossessed in his favor. He was certainly
far from an agreeable looking man, but Dean
was disposed to judge him without prejudice. He
knew that a fair outside sometimes accompanies
very undesirable traits, and the reverse might also
be the case.</p>

<p>"If you read my note, you understand that Mr.
Kirby is in want of a young man, or boy, to assist
him in the capacity of clerk or private secretary,"
the squire put in.</p>

<p>"I hope I may suit you, sir," said Dean earnestly,
addressing himself to Peter Kirby.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not very hard to suit. If a boy does
his duty, and studies my interests, he won't find me
a hard master."</p>

<p>"I think I can promise that I will serve you faithfully,
sir."</p>

<p>"Is your uncle willing to have you leave home?"
asked the squire.</p>

<p>Dean made the same answer as he had done to
Brandon.</p>

<p>"Then there will be no difficulty there."</p>

<p>"How soon would you like to have me begin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
sir; that is, if you are willing to engage me?"</p>

<p>"Well, you can report at French's Hotel on Saturday&mdash;day
after to-morrow. I suppose you can
find your way to New York alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. I have never been there, but I
am sure I shall have no difficulty."</p>

<p>"I will give the boy the necessary directions,
Kirby," said Squire Bates. "He has a tongue in his
head, and can ask questions."</p>

<p>"What salary do you expect, Master Dunham?"
asked Kirby.</p>

<p>"I will leave that to you, sir."</p>

<p>"I am willing to pay a fair salary, say twenty-five
dollars a month and your board and lodging thrown
in. Will that be satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"It is more than I anticipated," said Dean, quite
dazzled by the offer. He reckoned that he would be
able to send some money home to his uncle and
aunt every month&mdash;and thus have the pleasure of
making up to some extent for the expense which
they had incurred on his account.</p>

<p>"Then that matter is settled. Here is a card with
my address on it. You will find me at French's Hotel
at one o'clock in the day. If anything occurs to
detain me, you can wait in the office till I return.
My friend Bates here will supply money for your
journey."</p>

<p>Dean understood that there was nothing more to
be said, and he rose and took his leave. He went
home in a fever of excitement, for he felt that he was
about to enter the great world of which he had heard
so much, and which he so earnestly longed to see.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN MEETS AN ADVENTUROUS YOUNG MAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Adin Dunham and his wife were surprised and
dazzled by the brilliant prospects of their nephew.</p>

<p>"Did this Mr. Kirby really agree to pay you
twenty-five dollars a month, Dean?" asked the carpenter.</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, and he asked if it would be satisfactory."</p>

<p>"It seems strange," mused Adin. "Why, when
I was your age I was workin' for fifty cents a week
and my board."</p>

<p>"I get board, too, Uncle Adin."</p>

<p>"It's a great offer. And you're a stranger to him
too."</p>

<p>"Yes; he took me on Squire Bates's recommendation."</p>

<p>"I should have thought he'd have wanted the
place for his own boy."</p>

<p>"Brandon would like to leave Waterford, but I
don't believe he wants to work. It is all the better
for me."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in boys being idle, but there's no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
call for Brandon Bates to work if he don't want to.
The squire's rich enough."</p>

<p>And then the carpenter's brow contracted in perplexity.
He couldn't understand why a rich man
should take what did not belong to him, and he
had never got over the impression made on him on
the day of the robbery by the long tusk-like teeth of
the masked figure.</p>

<p>"Father," said Mrs. Dunham anxiously, "do you
think it's safe for a boy as young as Dean to go out
into the world alone? He's only a child."</p>

<p>"I'm almost sixteen, aunt," said Dean mortified.</p>

<p>"But you don't know nothin' of the world."</p>

<p>"Neither do you or I, wife, though we're both
risin' sixty. Dean has got to take his chances. I
hope this Kirby's a likely man. What does he look
like, Dean?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't fancy his appearance much," Dean
admitted. "He is very dark and sallow, and there's
something queer about the eyes. But I suppose he
can't help his looks."</p>

<p>"Handsome is that handsome does," replied Mrs.
Dunham. "I've heard tell that villains is sometimes
very scrumptious in appearance."</p>

<p>"I guess he's all right, aunt. He didn't make himself,
you know."</p>

<p>"I wish you hadn't got to go to New York alone,
Dean. Don't you think Mr. Kirby'd wait a day, and
then you could go with him?"</p>

<p>"I want to go alone, aunt. I hope I'm smart
enough to find my way."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll trust him, wife," said Adin Dunham. "He
means we'll, and if he's keerful he'll come out all
right."</p>

<p>At length the morning came for Dean's departure.
He bade good-bye to the old folks, and walked proudly
to the railroad station with a bundle of clothing under
his arm.</p>

<p>Rather to his surprise he found Squire Bates at the
little depot, walking up and down on the platform.</p>

<p>"So you're starting, are you, Dean?" said the
squire.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll do your duty by your employer."</p>

<p>"I shall try to do so, sir."</p>

<p>"I have indorsed you, and he has taken you on
my recommendation."</p>

<p>"I ought to thank you for that, sir."</p>

<p>"I take it for granted that you will verify the good
things I have said of you. If you don't&mdash;if you throw
discredit on me and on your worthy uncle and aunt,
why then&mdash;" and he paused.</p>

<p>Dean listened to hear how he would end the sentence.</p>

<p>"Then," resumed the squire, "I honestly advise
you to stay away, and not return to Waterford."</p>

<p>"I won't come back unless I can come back with
a good record," said Dean impetuously.</p>

<p>"A good resolution! Stick to it, my lad."</p>

<p>The train came up with a rush, and Dean got on
board He was a little disturbed by the squire's parting
words. Why should he harp so much on Dean's
acting discreditably?</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"It almost seems as if he expected I would," soliloquized
Dean. "If I know myself, I know that I am
honest, industrious and faithful. Mr. Kirby won't be
disappointed in me, unless he is an unreasonable
man."</p>

<p>Waterford was about fifty miles from New York,
and the journey consumed two hours. Dean was considerably
interested in looking out of the window at
the towns along the railroad. But besides this, he
scanned the faces of the passengers around him.</p>

<p>Just behind him was a boy about his own age, who
after a while leaned over and said, "Come back here
and sit with me."</p>

<p>Dean was of a social disposition, and needed no
second invitation.</p>

<p>His new acquaintance was a pleasant-looking boy
of sixteen, with dark hair and dark eyes, and a bright,
alert look.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To New York."</p>

<p>"Do you expect to stay there?"</p>

<p>"No, I am going to work for a gentleman whom I
am to find at French's Hotel."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know where that is."</p>

<p>"Do you? Then you have the advantage of me.
I was never in New York since I was a very little
boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's easy enough to find it. We shall land at
the Grand Central Depot. You can take a Fourth
Avenue car in front of it, and it'll carry you right by
French's Hotel."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it far?"</p>

<p>"About three miles, I guess."</p>

<p>"That's a good distance."</p>

<p>"It isn't much in the city. I didn't know you had
a place. I was going to ask you to join me."</p>

<p>"Why what are you going to do?" Dean asked in
some curiosity.</p>

<p>"You won't give me away, will you?"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I mean you won't tell my plans to any one?"</p>

<p>"Not if you don't want me to."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going out West," said the boy, nodding
impressively.</p>

<p>"You are! Have you got friends there?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm going in for a little excitement. I'm
going out West to hunt Indians!" and the speaker
eyed Dean to see how he was impressed by the declaration.</p>

<p>"But what good is that going to do you?" asked
Dean, perplexed.</p>

<p>"Oh, there'll be no end of excitement. It'll show
what I am made of. I shouldn't wonder if some
writer would make a story out of my adventures."</p>

<p>"But suppose the Indians should hunt you?" suggested
Dean.</p>

<p>"I must take my chance of that," answered the
boy loftily. "If there wasn't any risk, there wouldn't
be any excitement or glory."</p>

<p>"Are your folks willing you should go?" queried
Dean.</p>

<p>"No; they don't know where I am. I left home
on the sly."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't they worry about you?"</p>

<p>"Just at first, but I shall write to them when I am
far enough away. They'll be proud enough of me,
when they read about my exploits. Maybe there'll
be a play written about me. When I get home I
shouldn't mind going round, playing in it myself.
Have you got any money?"</p>

<p>"No, only my fare to New York and a quarter
over."</p>

<p>"Then it would be no use for you to go with me.
It'll take money to get out West, and to pay for a gun
and ammunition. I shall get them at Chicago, I
think."</p>

<p>"Have you considerable money with you?" Dean
ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>"A little over a hundred dollars. You see I had
that much in the Savings Bank. It's presents I've
got from different persons in the last five years. I
drew it all out a day or two since, and decided to
start out in search of glory."</p>

<p>"I don't think you ought to go without letting your
folks know about it," said Dean.</p>

<p>"Oh, they would oppose it, of course. They think
I'm a baby, but I'm a year older than Daredevil Dick,
the Young Hunter of the Rio Grande. I suppose
you've read about him?"</p>

<p>"No, I never heard of him."</p>

<p>"I thought everybody had heard of him. I think
I'm smart enough to do as much as he did."</p>

<p>Dean learned that his young companion's name
was Guy Gladstone, and that his father was born in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
England, but had come to America at an early age,
and was a successful manufacturer. Guy would not
tell him where his parents lived.</p>

<p>As their train ran into the depot, Guy said, "I guess
I'll go to French's with you and stay one night. I
shan't remain in the city any longer for fear my friends
will track me."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN TAKES MR. KIRBY BY SURPRISE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dean found it to his advantage to have in his company
one who was familiar with the city. Together
he and Guy boarded a Fourth Avenue car and rode
through Fourth Avenue into the Bowery, and later
through Center Street.</p>

<p>Guy pointed out prominent buildings as they rode
along, among them the Cooper Institute and Tombs
Prison. Dean's interest was strongly excited.</p>

<p>"I should think you'd rather live here than go out
West," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of civilization," answered Guy rather
grandly. "Give me the wild untrammeled life of the
plains."</p>

<p>"But I don't see what it's going to lead to," objected
Dean. "You can't make money out there."</p>

<p>"I'm not after money; I want glory," answered
Guy.</p>

<p>"I prefer money," said Dean, "just at present."</p>

<p>They reached French's hotel, and entered. This
was some years since, before the temporary closing
of this old established house for travelers.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd better go up to the register and see whether
your friend has a room here," suggested Guy.</p>

<p>Dean adopted the suggestion, and looking over the
record found this entry:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Kirby</span>, Chicago. Room 197.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's here," he said in a tone of relief. "Is
Mr. Kirby at home?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I will send up and see," said the clerk. "Do
you wish to go up at the same time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll wait down here," said Guy. "If Mr. Kirby
doesn't expect you to room with him, we can take a
room together."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should like that."</p>

<p>Dean followed the bell boy upstairs to one of the
upper floors. He had never been in a large hotel
before, and as saw door after door opening on the
corridor he thought the hotel must be one of the
largest buildings in New York. In this, of course, he
was very much mistaken.</p>

<p>"That's Mr. Kirby's room," said the bellboy, pointing
to 197. "Shall I knock, or will you?"</p>

<p>"I'll go in; he expects me," answered Dean; and,
with a want of ceremony which was the result of his
inexperience, he did not stop to knock, but opened
the door.</p>

<p>Sitting at a table was his employer, with a number
of bank bills spread out before him, which he appeared
to be engaged in counting. Naturally Dean glanced
at them, and his surprise was great when he recognized
the denomination of the bills.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>They were all fifties! What could it mean? Was
this man Kirby the one who had robbed his uncle?
But his intimate relations with Squire Bates presented
another explanation. The bills might have been
received from the squire.</p>

<p>Dean's reflections were cut short by his employer.</p>

<p>With a look of alarm and annoyance he swept the
bills together, and turning to Dean, said, harshly,
"Why did you come in without knocking?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me!" said Dean, in a tone of apology,
"I didn't think."</p>

<p>"It was positively rude," said Kirby in an excited
tone. "One would know that you had been brought
up in the country."</p>

<p>"I haven't been round much," said Dean, "but I
hope to improve, especially if I travel about with
you."</p>

<p>"There's no harm done," said Peter Kirby, cooling
down rapidly, concluding that Dean had seen
nothing to excite his suspicions; "but I was a little
startled when you opened the door. It's dangerous
for a man to be seen with money in a large city like
this, for there are plenty of designing persons who
might seek to relieve him of it."</p>

<p>"I hope you don't suspect me, Mr. Kirby."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Well, you left Waterford this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Where is your luggage?"</p>

<p>"Here, sir," answered Dean, showing his bundle.</p>

<p>Kirby frowned.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"It will never do to travel with a bundle like that.
You must have a valise. I haven't time to go round
with you. Do you think you can be trusted to find
a place where they are sold?"</p>

<p>"I have a friend who will go with me."</p>

<p>"What friend?" asked Kirby sharply.</p>

<p>"It's a boy I got acquainted with on the train&mdash;a
boy about my own age, named Guy Gladstone."</p>

<p>"Oh, a boy!" repeated Peter Kirby, evidently relieved.</p>

<p>"He would like to have me occupy a room with
him, unless you wish me to be with you."</p>

<p>"I have no objection; but mind, I shan't allow
him to join our party and travel with us," said Kirby
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No; he would not care to. He is going out
West at once."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he will only stay here one night."</p>

<p>"Here is a five-dollar bill. You can take it and
look up a valise. Three or four dollars ought to buy
one. A small one will answer, judging from the
size of your bundle. I suppose you have had nothing
to eat since you left Waterford?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You can go to a restaurant and get some dinner.
The other boy will show you where to find one. I
am obliged to go out on business. This hotel is on
the European system, and doesn't provide regular
board."</p>

<p>"Shall I take my bundle with me, sir?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; you can transfer the contents to the valise
when you have bought one. When you return you
can put your name on the hotel book, taking a room
with this Guy Gladstone."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Dean descended to the office and communicated
to Guy what his employer had told him.</p>

<p>"I have put my valise in the baggage-room," said
Guy, and got a check for it. "I am glad you are going
to take a room with me. I wish you would join
me altogether."</p>

<p>"Then you'd have to pay expenses for both, as I
have no money."</p>

<p>"That would be an objection, as I have only about
enough money for my own use."</p>

<p>The two boys went out together, but, both being
hungry, decided to postpone purchasing the valise
until after dinner. They went into a restaurant on
Fulton Street, and ordered a dinner at moderate cost,
which they enjoyed with great relish. They were
of an age to have a hearty appetite.</p>

<p>"It seems strange to me to be eating here," said
Dean. "I never before ate at a hotel or restaurant."</p>

<p>"Your life must have been very quiet," said Guy.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I expect to have some excitement
now."</p>

<p>"In what business is your employer?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Dean.</p>

<p>Guy regarded him with surprise.</p>

<p>"You are going to work for him, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet you don't know what business he is
in?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What are you to do? Have you any idea?"</p>

<p>"I am to be private secretary, or clerk, I believe."</p>

<p>"Are you to get good pay?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars a month and my board,"
answered Dean proudly.</p>

<p>Guy looked amazed.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty steep salary to pay a green boy
from the country. No offense, Dean. You are green,
you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know I am, but I don't mean to stay so."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you will. You look as if you'd
learn fast."</p>

<p>"I'll try to, at any rate."</p>

<p>After dinner they found a place near the corner of
Wall Street and Broadway, where Dean bought a
valise of neat appearance and good quality for three
dollars. He adopted Mr. Kirby's suggestion, and,
opening his bundle, put the contents into his new
purchase.</p>

<p>"Now you don't look so countrified," said Guy.</p>

<p>They turned down Wall Street, looking curiously
into the windows as they passed. At one&mdash;a broker's
office&mdash;Dean found something to surprise him.</p>

<p>At a large counter stood Mr. Kirby with a roll of
bills before him&mdash;the same, no doubt, that Dean had
seen him counting at the hotel. He appeared to be
purchasing government bonds, for a clerk passed
him several, and gathered up the bills in exchange.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you see that's so interesting?" asked
Guy.</p>

<p>"That man at the counter is my employer."</p>

<p>"Humph! I don't like his looks. He seems to
have plenty of money, though."</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="small">AN EVENING AT NIBLO'S.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"I wish I knew whether that money I saw Mr.
Kirby counting belonged to my poor uncle," thought
Dean.</p>

<p>He didn't venture to take his boy friend into his confidence,
for his suspicions, strong as they were, might
prove to do his employer injustice. At any rate he
resolved to keep on the lookout for additional evidence
which might tend either to confirm or to disprove
them.</p>

<p>If he had been present in the broker's office, he
would have heard something to confirm the distrust
he felt. When Peter Kirby was asked by the broker's
clerk, as usual, his name, he hesitated for a second,
then answered boldly "Renwick Bates." So in the
broker's book the sale of bonds was recorded as having
been made to Renwick Bates. Had the squire
known this, he would have felt very angry with his
confederate, as, in case the fifty-dollar notes were
traced, his name would be involved.</p>

<p>Guy and Dean were taking supper at a restaurant
not far from the hotel when Mr. Kirby came in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
sat down at a table near them. Guy was the first to
notice him.</p>

<p>"There's your respected employer, Dean," he said
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"So he is. I wonder whether I ought to speak to
him."</p>

<p>"Wait till you get through supper."</p>

<p>Presently another man came in and took a seat at
the same table. He seemed to have been expected.</p>

<p>"You're late, Pringle," said Kirby.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was detained. I went to Jersey City to
see my wife."</p>

<p>"You are better provided than I. I have never
found time to get married."</p>

<p>"Well, it's awkward sometimes in our business to
have such an incumbrance."</p>

<p>"Does your wife know what business you are
in?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely. She's a good church woman, and
would be horrified. She thinks I am a traveling
salesman."</p>

<p>Kirby laughed.</p>

<p>"I have no wife to deceive," he said. "That is
where I have the advantage of you. However, you
are no worse off than the captain. I've been up to
see him."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the country," answered Kirby evasively.
"He's a big gun out there. They call him squire."</p>

<p>Both laughed.</p>

<p>"So he is married?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and has a son who is his very image, even
to the long, tusk-like teeth. If ever he gets into
trouble it's because they will give him away."</p>

<p>"They certainly are very peculiar."</p>

<p>"They are dangerous," responded Kirby with
emphasis. "If I had them I would get rid of them in
short order, but the captain owned to me that he was
afraid of the dentist."</p>

<p>"I suppose his family are in the dark as to his
position?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. His son is an impudent young cub.
It would have given me pleasure to box his ears.
He evidently thinks his father a man of great importance,
and is inflated by his own estimate of his
social consequence."</p>

<p>"What makes the captain stay in such an obscure
place?"</p>

<p>"He tells me it is on account of his family, and
also because it adds to his safety."</p>

<p>"When are we to see him?"</p>

<p>"He will be in Chicago next month, and lay out
work for us to do. One thing I will say for him, he
has good executive talent, but he ought not to keep
out of the way so much of the time."</p>

<p>Then the talk drifted into other channels.</p>

<p>To this conversation Dean listened with the utmost
attention. He felt interested and excited. He could
not fail to understand that Kirby was referring to
Squire Bates. The mystery was deepening. Who
and what was this man who in Oakford posed as a
lawyer, a reputable citizen, and a Justice of the Peace?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
It was clear that he was allied to some outside
organization in which he wished to conceal his membership.</p>

<p>This man Kirby who was now Dean's employer,
was a friend and associate. Why under the circumstances
should Squire Bates have been willing to send
him off as Kirby's clerk or secretary? If there was
anything to conceal, it was only giving him an opportunity
to find it out.</p>

<p>"I must keep my eyes open," thought Dean. "I
mean to find out who robbed my uncle, and whether
Squire Bates had anything to do with it. If I could
only recover the money I should be happy."</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about so intently?" asked
Guy.</p>

<p>"I want to get out of the restaurant without my
employer seeing me," answered Dean in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Why? Would he object to your coming here!"</p>

<p>"Wait till we get into the street."</p>

<p>The boys managed to effect their retreat without
attracting the notice of Kirby or Pringle.</p>

<p>"Now what's it all about?" asked Guy.</p>

<p>"They were talking confidentially, and Mr. Kirby
would be angry if he thought I had heard them."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it," said Guy carelessly. He was not
a boy of much curiosity, and felt much less interest
in Dean's concerns than his own. "Well, what shall
we do this evening?"</p>

<p>"Go to bed, I suppose."</p>

<p>"But why not go to some theater?"</p>

<p>"I should like to go," said Dean, "but I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
know that I ought to use the money Mr. Kirby gave
me for such a purpose."</p>

<p>"You needn't mind that. Didn't you tell me you
were to receive twenty-five dollars a month?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then if he makes any fuss, tell him to charge
the expense of the theatre to your salary."</p>

<p>"I might do that. How much will it cost to go
to the theater?"</p>

<p>"We can get a fair seat for fifty cents."</p>

<p>"Then I think I'll go," said Dean after some hesitation.</p>

<p>"Have you any choice as to theatres?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know anything about them. I never
went to a theatre in my life."</p>

<p>"Well, you are a fresh young countryman, and
no mistake. Here, I'll get an evening paper, and see
what's playing at the different theaters."</p>

<p>The result was that Niblo's was selected. It is not
necessary to mention the name of the play, which
was at that time a popular favorite, but is now forgotten.
The two boys obtained seats in the balcony,
rather far off from the stage, but both were possessed
of good eyes, and had no difficulty in seeing what
was passing on the boards.</p>

<p>Dean was enchanted. He had had but vague
ideas of what a theater was like, and to him everything
seemed real. There was one place where the
villain of the piece throws the heroine from a
bridge into the water. Dean uttered a little exclamation.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>Guy turned to him with a smile.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I almost thought it was real," said Dean. "I
was afraid she would drown."</p>

<p>"And I dare say you wanted to punish the brutal
ruffian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," admitted Dean.</p>

<p>"Probably he and the girl are excellent friends in
real life. Why, they are husband and wife," he
added, referring to the play bill.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible."</p>

<p>"I envy you, Dean. You enjoy the play much
better than I do, for you believe in it while I know
it for a sham&mdash;that is, I know it's merely play-acting.
Look in the next row&mdash;you see there is some one
who believes in it as much as you do."</p>

<p>Guy pointed to a lady in plain, old-fashioned attire
who was wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>"She takes it worse than you do," whispered Guy.</p>

<p>The play continued, and ended at last to the satisfaction
of Dean, who saw all the bad characters
visited with retribution, while oppressed innocence
and virtue through much tribulation attained happiness
and peace.</p>

<p>When the play was over, they joined the throng
and passed out through the lobby. Suddenly a cry
was heard from a little distance in front.</p>

<p>"I've been robbed! I've lost my pocket-book,"
and a small man with a red and excited face began
to feel wildly in his pockets for his lost treasure.</p>

<p>At a little distance pushing their way out, were two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
tall men, whom Dean recognized as Peter Kirby and
his friend Pringle. While others in the immediate
neighborhood of the victim were regarding him with
looks of curiosity or sympathy these two seemed to
feel no interest, and to be only intent on getting out
into the street.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="small">ON THE FALL RIVER BOAT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dean didn't see his employer till the next morning.
Mr. Kirby did not ask him where he had spent the
evening previous, as Dean thought it possible he
might do. Indeed he seemed in unusual good spirits,
and handed his new clerk a couple of dollars to
defray any expenses he might incur.</p>

<p>"Are we going to stay long in New York?" Dean
ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"No, we go to Boston this afternoon by the Fall
River line."</p>

<p>This was a surprise to Dean, who fancied they
were bound west.</p>

<p>When he suggested this, Mr. Kirby said, "I have
a little business to transact in Boston first. We can
go West from there as well as from New York."</p>

<p>Dean was not upon the whole sorry that he should
have an opportunity of seeing a city so famous as
Boston. "I shall feel that I am quite a traveler,"
he said to himself.</p>

<p>During the forenoon he was called upon to bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
good-bye to Guy Gladstone. That young man had
concluded his arrangements for a visit to his Indian
hunting grounds, and was in a hurry to leave New
York, as he was liable at any moment to meet some
friend of his father's who might detain him, or ask
him questions which it would embarrass him to
answer.</p>

<p>At about fifteen minutes to five o'clock Dean and
his employer went down to the foot of Murray Street,
and went on board the steamer Pilgrim of the famous
Fall River line. Mr. Kirby succeeded in obtaining
a stateroom, with two berths, and allowed Dean to
occupy the upper one.</p>

<p>Our young hero surveyed with admiration the
palatial accommodations of the great steamer; the
grand saloon, the showy chandeliers, the handsome
furniture and costly mirrors.</p>

<p>"You can amuse yourself as you please," said
Kirby. "I shall be occupied till about ten o'clock,
when I shall be ready to go to bed."</p>

<p>He showed Dean the way to the supper room, and
told him he could take supper whenever he pleased.
Dean availed himself of this permission, and after
supper stopped at the book table in the main saloon,
which was under the charge of a boy rather older
than himself, arrayed in a blue uniform. This boy
he found very social and agreeable. He learned
that he was called Dan, but did not inquire his last
name.</p>

<p>"Don't you get tired of traveling on the boat?"
asked Dean.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But it's the same thing every night."</p>

<p>"I have my business to attend to. That prevents
it becoming monotonous."</p>

<p>"Are you ever sea-sick?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Dan with a smile. "It would
take a good deal to upset me now, I'm so used to it."</p>

<p>"Do you expect to follow the business when
you're a man?"</p>

<p>"No, I think I shall look for a place in a wholesale
store in Boston next fall. It won't pay as well
at first, but it will lead to a good salary in time. I
suppose you are going to Boston?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not to stay."</p>

<p>"How long do you stay there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. That depends upon my
employer."</p>

<p>"The man you are traveling with?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I noticed him. He is a tall, sallow man, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you been working for him long?"</p>

<p>"No, I've only just started."</p>

<p>"What do you do?"</p>

<p>"I am his private secretary&mdash;that's what he calls
me, but I don't know yet what my duties will be."</p>

<p>"He don't look like a man likely to employ a
private secretary," said Dan shrewdly.</p>

<p>"I don't know what sort of men do have secretaries,"
Dean said in a perplexed tone.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, governors, members of Congress, and sometimes
authors. I don't suppose he's either of those
three."</p>

<p>"I think not," answered Dean smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, he has a right to have one, at any rate. Do
you like him?"</p>

<p>"I can't say I do, though I have nothing to complain
of. He seems to be liberal."</p>

<p>"How much does he pay you, if you don't mind
telling me?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars a month."</p>

<p>"And your expenses besides?"</p>

<p>Dean nodded.</p>

<p>"My, that's fine pay. I'd be a private secretary
myself for that."</p>

<p>"If he wants two, I'll recommend you."</p>

<p>"You can tell all you know about me," said Dan
laughing.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be much, but I can judge of you
by your looks."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I couldn't recommend your employer
very highly on that ground."</p>

<p>Here two or three customers came up and inquired
of the young news-agent about some of the latest
novels. Dean, seeing that his friend was occupied,
went to the after part of the boat, and seating himself
on a camp stool watched with interest the progress
of the vessel and the shores so far as they
were visible. It was now dusk, and shadows played
over the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Meanwhile where was Mr. Kirby?</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>After a hearty supper in the dining saloon he
smoked a cigar on the lower deck, and then began
to wander about the steamer, choosing especially
the walk that ran between the outside staterooms
and the side railing.</p>

<p>As he stood beside the railing a stout man looking
like a prosperous merchant came out of his stateroom,
and locked the door behind him. Then he passed
through the nearest passage way into the saloon.</p>

<p>"He looks as if he might carry something of
value," thought Kirby. "I'll venture to examine."</p>

<p>Waiting till the coast was clear he produced a pass
key, of which he had managed to gain possession,
and inserted it in the lock of stateroom No. 157, as
we will venture to designate it.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Kirby entered the room.</p>

<p>He drew a match from his pocket, and lighting it
looked swiftly and searchingly about him.</p>

<p>There was a small hand-bag on the lower berth.</p>

<p>"I'd take the bag if I dared, but it is too large to
put in my pocket," thought Kirby. "Perhaps I can
open it."</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a bunch of keys of various
sizes, and tried one after another. The fourth
proved to fit.</p>

<p>The bag, when opened, displayed a variety of
contents in which Kirby was not interested. But
one article attracted his attention. This was a square
pasteboard box with the name of Tiffany upon it.</p>

<p>"I'll take that at a venture," soliloquized Kirby.
"Since it bears Tiffany's name the contents must be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
value. I won't stay any longer, for it might prove
dangerous."</p>

<p>He relocked the bag, opened the door of the stateroom,
and locking it again securely prepared to leave
the spot.</p>

<p>He was only just in time, for the occupant of the
stateroom appeared a minute later, accompanied by
a younger man.</p>

<p>"Yes," Kirby heard him say. "I bought a watch
for my daughter from Tiffany. I'll show it to you."</p>

<p>"A narrow escape!" murmured Kirby. "If he
had found me in his stateroom, there would have
been no end of a disturbance. I got through just in
time."</p>

<p>Kirby went into the saloon, and taking out an
evening paper began to read it attentively, or rather
he appeared to, but out of the corner of his eyes he
was watching for the return of the gentleman he had
robbed.</p>

<p>He did not have long to wait. The two gentlemen
came into the saloon, and one, the elder, seemed
much excited.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Johnson," he said, "there are thieves
on board. I left the watch in a pasteboard box in
my hand bag less than half an hour since&mdash;indeed I
think it is only fifteen minutes, and it has disappeared."</p>

<p>"Are you absolutely sure, Mr. Margrave?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for when I went to my stateroom, after
coming up from the supper room, I opened the bag
and saw that the box was there."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>"And now it is gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you saw that yourself."</p>

<p>"But I don't see how, in the short time you were
absent, any one could have got in and effected the
robbery."</p>

<p>"Nor do I, but it was done."</p>

<p>"What shall you do about it?"</p>

<p>"Notify the officers of the boat, but I fear that
won't do any good."</p>




<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN BECOMES SUSPICIOUS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Of course great excitement followed among the
passengers. The two gentlemen went below, and
soon returned with a quiet-looking man, not particularly
noticeable except for a pair of keen, sharp
eyes.</p>

<p>"That's the detective," whispered a traveling man
whose business required him to make the journey
between New York and Boston twice a week.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen and the detective went outside,
and made an examination of the stateroom, but didn't
find any traces of the lost watch.</p>

<p>"I'd like to be sure the article is really lost," said
the detective. "On several occasions I have found
that it was only mislaid. In the present instance
there seems really to have been a robbery."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of that," said Margrave ruefully.</p>

<p>"Did you notice any one loitering near the stateroom
when you left it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I observed that a man was leaning
over the rail."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha! we are coming to something. Can you
describe him?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot. You see I had no suspicion
that any one was likely to rob me."</p>

<p>"Very natural, but rather disappointing! You
didn't casually notice whether the man was short or
tall, or how he was dressed?"</p>

<p>"I think he was tall, and dressed in dark clothing."</p>

<p>"I fear this is too general to afford much satisfaction.
You see most of the men on board wear dark
clothes."</p>

<p>"I see, Mr. Lynx, that I am not likely to recover
the watch."</p>

<p>"Well, it is doubtful. Still, if you will give me a
description of it I can quietly put it into the hands of
the Boston police."</p>

<p>Mr. Margrave, at the suggestion of the detective,
wrote out a description before he left the boat, and
put it into his hands.</p>

<p>"I will keep my eyes open, Mr. Margrave," continued
the detective, "and notice whether I recognize
any professional thief among the passengers. I
know many of those who operate in New York and
Boston, and if I meet one of my old acquaintances
shall take the liberty of examining him."</p>

<p>Fortunately for Peter Kirby the scene of his operations
had been at the West, and though the detective
regarded him with some suspicion, for criminals
carry about with them a certain tell-tale look, he did
not feel justified in arresting him. If Margrave had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
been able to identify him as the man who had been
loitering near the stateroom, of course that would
have simplified matters.</p>

<p>It was not for some time that Dean heard what had
happened. On re-entering the saloon, Dan, the
young news agent, said to him:</p>

<p>"Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Outside."</p>

<p>"Very suspicious. A gentleman occupying an
outside stateroom has had his room entered and
robbed."</p>

<p>"Is that true?" asked Dean in excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes, he made a great fuss about it I saw him
going out with the boat detective, but I don't think
they found out anything."</p>

<p>Instantly Dean's mind reverted to the scene at the
theater, and the loss of a pocket-book by one of the
patrons of Niblo's. Was it possible that Mr. Kirby
could be connected with both robberies? It really
seemed that thefts took place wherever he went.</p>

<p>"What was taken?" he asked earnestly.</p>

<p>"A gold watch. The gentleman meant it for his
daughter. I think it was bought at Tiffany's in New
York."</p>

<p>"I was at a theater last evening," said Dean,
"and as we were coming out a man ahead of us
called out that he had been robbed of his pocket-book."</p>

<p>"Who do you mean by <i>us</i>&mdash;yourself and your employer?"</p>

<p>"No. A boy was with me&mdash;Guy Gladstone."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"Is he with you here?"</p>

<p>"No, he has gone out West to hunt Indians."</p>

<p>Dan, the news-agent, laughed.</p>

<p>"He'll be coming back soon without having seen
an Indian, I have no doubt. I say, Dean, isn't it
rather remarkable that there are robberies wherever
you go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is singular," said Dean in a musing
tone.</p>

<p>"It really looks suspicious," continued Dan.
"However, you are my friend and I won't give you
away."</p>

<p>"No, don't!" said Dean, accepting the joke in
good humor.</p>

<p>Dean walked away, plunged in thought. Again he
went outside, and walked round to an unfrequented
part of the steamer. Suddenly he saw a man in front
of him draw something from his pocket, and with a
quick movement throw it far out upon the water. It
was light enough to see that it was a white pasteboard
box of small size.</p>

<p>Rather surprised, Dean scanned the person who
had done this, and to his further astonishment recognized
him as Mr. Kirby, his employer.</p>

<p>Turning quickly, Peter Kirby in his turn saw Dean's
eyes fixed upon him, and he became irritated and
alarmed.</p>

<p>"What are you out here for?" he demanded
harshly.</p>

<p>"Why, is there any harm in being out here?"
asked Dean surprised.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>Kirby saw that he had made a false move, and
that this unreasonable taking to task of Dean was
likely to excite the boy's suspicions.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, calming down, "I don't know
that there is any harm in being out here, but you
might be imprudent and endanger your safety."</p>

<p>"How, Mr. Kirby?"</p>

<p>"I was once on board a steamer like this, when a
boy about your age came out, got up on the rail, and
by a sudden movement of the steamer was thrown
into the water. The poor fellow was drowned."</p>

<p>"I shan't imitate his example," said Dean. "I
think he was very foolish."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't found out yet whether you are
prudent or imprudent. I haven't known you long
enough. I thought it best to warn you, however."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"I am going into the saloon, but if you care to
remain outside I have no objection as long as you
are careful. I feel a certain responsibility about you,
as you are not used to traveling."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Dean would have been more grateful if he had
believed what Mr. Kirby was saying, but, young and
inexperienced though he was, he did not take much
stock in the sudden interest shown in him. He had
not noticed that Mr. Kirby felt any particular solicitude
about him in New York, though there were
plenty of scrapes that he might have got into
there.</p>

<p>Peter Kirby went back into the saloon, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
after Dean followed. He again sought the book
table.</p>

<p>"Well," said Dan, pleasantly, "have you found
out the robber?"</p>

<p>Dean shook his head.</p>

<p>"Do you know, or did you hear, whether the
stolen watch was in a box?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard Mr. Margrave say that it was in a
white pasteboard box. Have you found the box?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Dean. He did not feel at liberty
to tell what he had seen, but it confirmed him in the
idea that his employer, Peter Kirby, was the robber
of the stateroom.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Mr. Kirby came up to him.</p>

<p>"It is ten o'clock," he said. "I think you had
better go to bed."</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>Kirby led the way into the stateroom.</p>

<p>"I shall give you the top berth," he said. "You
are younger, and can climb up there more easily
than I."</p>

<p>"I shall be satisfied with either," said Dean.</p>

<p>Both went to bed and Dean was soon asleep.</p>

<p>Towards morning he thought it must be when he
woke up. The light was burning, and peeping out
from behind the curtains he saw that Kirby was
standing in the stateroom with something in his hand
which he was examining with evident satisfaction.
Dean's heart gave a sudden bound, when he recognized
this object as a beautiful gold watch of small
pattern. He laid back his head on the pillow, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
slight noise attracted the attention of Kirby, who
looked up to where his boy companion was lying.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! he's fast asleep!" he heard Kirby mutter,
"but I must be cautious, as, if he saw this watch,
he might suspect something."</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="small">MR. KIRBY WRITES A LETTER FOR EFFECT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Any lingering doubts Dean might have were of
course dissipated by the sight of the watch. It was
evident that his employer was a professional thief and
pickpocket. The question arose, ought he or ought
he not to expose and denounce him?</p>

<p>Should he do so he would find himself adrift, without
money or situation. Moreover, he would lose
the chance of proving Kirby the accomplice of Squire
Bates in the robbery of his uncle. On the whole, he
decided to wait, and conceal from Kirby the knowledge
that he had acquired concerning him.</p>

<p>Kirby remained but a day in Boston. What business
he attended to Dean didn't know. He was left
to his own devices, and managed to see Boston
Common, Bunker Hill Monument, and to ride out on
a Washington Street line of cars to Roxbury. Late
in the evening he started for Chicago with Mr. Kirby,
and two days later the two registered at the Commercial
Hotel, corner of Lake and Dearborn Streets.
Dean enjoyed the journey. He caught sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
famous falls of Niagara, and would like to have
stopped for a few hours there to see the cataract at
his leisure, but of course didn't venture to make such
a request of Mr. Kirby, who, as he knew, was
traveling for his own purposes, not for the gratification
of his private secretary.</p>

<p>They reached Chicago in the morning and took
breakfast at the hotel.</p>

<p>After breakfast Kirby said, "Come out with me,
Dean; I will show you a little of the city."</p>

<p>Dean accepted the invitation with alacrity.</p>

<p>The two walked through some of the principal
thoroughfares. Dean was impressed by the large
and handsome buildings everywhere to be seen in
the business portions of the city. Finally they turned
into a minor street, lined with smaller and less pretentious
structures.</p>

<p>Peter Kirby halted at last before a pawnbroker's
office, with the three golden balls displayed above
the entrance.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, Dean," said Kirby, suddenly,
"I am a little short of money, and must borrow some
on an article I don't need at present."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" said Dean, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"This is a pawnbroker's office. Take this watch,
and ask the pawnbroker to lend you twenty-five
dollars on it. You can give him your own name,
and for address you may say Buffalo."</p>

<p>"But I don't live in Buffalo."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter. He will be more apt to let
you have the money if he thinks you came from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
distance. It isn't necessary to give the correct
address."</p>

<p>Mr. Kirby drew from his pocket the gold watch
which Dean had seen in the stateroom of the Pilgrim,
and which he was sure had been stolen from the
elderly gentleman who had complained of being
robbed.</p>

<p>Dean started and flushed, as Kirby held the watch
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Is that your watch?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; it belongs to my wife. I shall redeem it
before I return East. If the pawnbroker won't give
you twenty-five dollars, get as much as you can.
You look like a boy sharp at a bargain. Say that it
belonged to your uncle."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kirby," said Dean, "I would rather not do
what you ask me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Kirby, angrily.</p>

<p>"What I say. I would rather not pawn that watch
for you."</p>

<p>"Look here, boy," said Kirby, roughly, "are you
aware that you are behaving in a very foolish, not to
say impudent manner?"</p>

<p>"I have my reasons for declining," said Dean.</p>

<p>"Why do you think I pay you wages?" asked
Kirby, frowning.</p>

<p>"I understood that I was to be your private
secretary."</p>

<p>"And a mighty easy place you have had so far!"</p>

<p>"That is true, sir."</p>

<p>"This is almost the first thing I have asked you to
do, and you refuse."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>"I told you that I had my reasons for it," said
Dean, resolutely, though his look was troubled.</p>

<p>"The boy suspects me," thought Kirby. "It is
time I got rid of him."</p>

<p>"We will discuss this matter hereafter," he said
quietly. "We shall have to come to an understanding.
Stay here till I come out."</p>

<p>He went into the pawnbroker's, and in less than
five minutes returned with a roll of bills.</p>

<p>"It appears that I have to do my own work,
though you are in my employ," he said with a sneer.</p>

<p>Dean didn't reply. He began to suspect that he
would not long retain the place which he at present
filled. He resolved to look about him, and if he
saw anywhere a chance to get into the employ of
some one else to take advantage of it. In a money
way he might not do so well, but he did not wish to
remain connected any longer than he could help
with a man of Mr. Kirby's character.</p>

<p>At the Commercial Hotel, Dean and his employer
occupied the same room. They remained in the
Lake City for a week.</p>

<p>Dean's labors were very light, being confined to
the writing of four letters, one of which is subjoined
as a specimen. It was addressed to a certain John
Carver, of San Francisco. It ran thus:</p>


<p class="sigleft p2t"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>You may sell out the two hundred shares of mining
stock which you hold of mine as soon as a satisfactory
price can be obtained. I think I ought to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
twenty dollars per share, but will accept eighteen if
you think it best. The amount you can deposit to
my credit in the Bank of Nevada.</p>

<p class="sigright p2b">Yours truly,&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;<br />
<span class="smcap">Peter Kirby</span>.</p>


<p>Kirby watched Dean's face when he was writing
this letter. It was intended for effect simply, and to
dispel the suspicions of his young secretary. But
Dean had been gaining rapidly in knowledge of the
world, and especially in the knowledge of his employer,
and he had little belief in his mining property.</p>

<p>"How much do you think that mining stock cost
me, Dean?" said Kirby, in a confidential tone.</p>

<p>"I couldn't guess, sir."</p>

<p>"Four dollars and a quarter per share. How
much would that be on two hundred shares?"</p>

<p>"Eight hundred and fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"Correct! I see you are quick at figures. Now,
even if I sell at eighteen, and I am certain to get
that, I shall make a very tidy profit. Let me see, it
would foot up thirty-six hundred dollars&mdash;a profit of
twenty seven hundred, allowing the extra fifty for
broker's commission."</p>

<p>"Are you going to San Francisco, Mr. Kirby?"
asked Dean.</p>

<p>"I may; I am not quite sure. It is a lucky city
for me. Whenever I go there I make money."</p>

<p>Dean could not help wondering whether he made
it in the same way as on the Fall River boat.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been rather short of money lately," continued
Mr. Kirby, "because I was not willing to
sell out my shares except at the top of the market.
However I think I may venture to sell now."</p>

<p>Dean made no comment He did not believe that
Kirby owned any mining shares at all.</p>

<p>"Shall I mail the letter for you, Mr. Kirby?"
asked the young secretary.</p>

<p>"No; I shall be going out myself," answered his
employer. "You may hand me the letter when you
have put it in the envelope."</p>

<p>Kirby carelessly dropped the letter into his pocket,
and when Dean was out of the way he destroyed it.
It was never intended to be mailed.</p>

<p>"The boy looks skeptical," said Kirby to himself,
as he sent Dean to the office to buy a postage stamp.
"It isn't easy to pull the wool over his eyes. I
must get rid of him, and that soon."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

</div>


<p>Two days later Dean and his employer reached a
small town in Iowa which we will call Clifton. They
passed the night at the American Hotel, and occupied
a room with two beds. Kirby rose first in the
morning, and went out, leaving Dean asleep.</p>

<p>When the boy awoke he rose and dressed himself.
He was putting on his coat when he noticed an open
letter addressed to Kirby which had fallen on the
floor. Dean picked it up, and was about to put it
away to return to Kirby, when his eye caught the
postmark "Waterford" and the signature Renwick
Bates.</p>

<p>Though under ordinary circumstances Dean would
not have felt justified in reading a letter not addressed
to himself, the peculiar circumstances, and the suspicion
he entertained relative to the share these two
men probably had in the robbery of his uncle, decided
him to take advantage of the opportunity which
presented itself to him of acquiring some information
on the subject.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>This was the letter which Dean read with an interest
that may be imagined:</p>


<p class="sigleft p2t"><span class="smcap">Friend Kirby</span>:</p>

<p>I have not received the government bonds which
you purchased with the bills I gave you to dispose
of. How did you send them? I cannot understand
how such a package could have miscarried if properly
addressed and forwarded with suitable precautions.
I shall hold you responsible for them, and
say emphatically that I regard the failure to reach
me as something strange and mysterious. I do not
like to express distrust, but I require you to send me
the receipt of the express company to whom you
committed the package.</p>

<p>In regard to the boy Dean you understand my
wishes. I don't wish him to return to Waterford. It
will be easy to get him into trouble at such a distance
from home that he will find it hard to get back.
You can write me a letter which I can show at my
discretion to his friends, which will discredit any
stories he may invent about you or myself.</p>

<p class="sigright p2b"><span class="smcap">Renwick Bates.</span></p>


<p>Dean read this letter with eager interest. He felt
that it would be a formidable proof against Squire
Bates, and he carefully concealed it in his inside vest
pocket.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Kirby means to get me into trouble," he
soliloquized. "I shall have to be on my guard."</p>

<p>Dean went below and took breakfast, not being in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the habit of waiting for his employer. Mr. Kirby
entered the breakfast-room as he was leaving it.</p>

<p>"We take the ten o'clock train," he said briefly.
"Don't leave the hotel."</p>

<p>"All right, sir, I'll stay in the office."</p>

<p>At ten o'clock they stepped on board a Western
bound train. Dean feared that Kirby would miss his
letter, and make inquiries about it, but its loss appeared
not to have been discovered. They took seats,
and the train started. Dean caught Kirby regarding
him with a peculiar gaze, and it made him uneasy.
Was he devising some plot, of which Dean was to be
the victim?</p>

<p>Two hours later the train had traversed fifty miles.
The train boy came through the car, carrying a supply
of the latest novels. Kirby was not in general
much of a reader, but on this occasion he stopped the
boy and looked over his books.</p>

<p>"I think I will take this book," he said, selecting
a Pinkerton detective story.</p>

<p>"I sell a good many of that series," said the boy
glibly.</p>

<p>Kirby put his hand into his pocket, and withdrew it
with a startled expression.</p>

<p>"I can't find my pocket-book," he said.</p>

<p>Several of the passengers looked round, and apprehensively
felt for their own wallets.</p>

<p>"When did you have it last, sir?" asked an old
gentleman in the next seat.</p>

<p>"At the Clifton railroad station, sir. I bought tickets
there."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sure you put back the wallet into your
pocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am positive."</p>

<p>"There must be a pickpocket on the train
then."</p>

<p>"But I haven't exposed myself," said Kirby puzzled.
"I took my seat here, with my boy, and have
not stirred since."</p>

<p>"Your son, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No; he is a boy in my employ."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the old man, eying Dean dubiously.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you suspect him of taking
it?" said Kirby in a low tone.</p>

<p>Dean heard these words, and he exclaimed indignantly.
"I am not a thief, if that is what the gentleman
means."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Kirby soothingly&mdash;"Still,
just to convince him now, you may as well search
your pockets."</p>

<p>Dean thrust his hand into his right pocket (he wore
a sack coat) and it came in contact with something
unexpected. He drew it out, with the lost pocket-book
in it.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" ejaculated Kirby.</p>

<p>"Just what I thought!" said the old man, nodding
emphatically.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have believed it," said Kirby.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kirby," said Dean, his face flaming with indignation,
"do you mean to charge me with taking
that pocket-book?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>"What else can I think? Oh, Dean, I am grieved
to find you dishonest."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of how it came into my pocket,"
said Dean hotly, "but I suspect."</p>

<p>"What do you suspect?"</p>

<p>"That you put it there to get me into trouble."</p>

<p>"You hear him!" said Kirby, turning to the old
man.</p>

<p>"What shameless effrontery!" exclaimed the old
gentleman. "I don't know what the world is coming
to. Have you ever missed anything before,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Two or three articles of jewelry," answered
Kirby, "but it never occurred to me to suspect the
boy."</p>

<p>"It seems pretty clear now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should say so."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dean, with flushed and angry countenance,
looked from one face to another, but everywhere
he met looks of distrust. It was clear that
the majority of the passengers believed him guilty.
He understood now the nature of the plot against
him, and the letter in his pocket would be a sufficient
proof of it. But he did not wish to produce it. He
chose rather to keep it on account of the evidence
which it contained against Squire Bates.</p>

<p>"What shall you do about it?" asked the old gentleman,
who seemed to feel particularly hostile against
Dean.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Kirby hesitating.</p>

<p>"The boy ought to be punished. If it were <i>my</i>
case, I would have him arrested."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I don't care to do that. He belongs to a
respectable family."</p>

<p>"Surely you won't keep him in your employ?"</p>

<p>"No, I shall feel compelled to discharge him.
Dean, you can leave the car at the next station.
You are no longer in my employ. For the sake of
your uncle and aunt, I shall not have you arrested,
but I must decline to employ you any longer."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir!" answered Dean. "If you will
pay me what you owe me for services, I will
leave you."</p>

<p>"Pay you what I owe you!" replied Kirby, as if
surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; you promised me twenty-five dollars
per month, and I have been with you three weeks."</p>

<p>"You have received money from me at different
times, and I owe you nothing. Besides, the jewelry
which you have taken will amount to more than
your wages."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kirby, I have taken no jewelry, and you
know it."</p>

<p>"How can you tolerate the boy's impudence?"
said the old man.</p>

<p>Kirby shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I have been very much deceived in him," he
answered, "but I cherish no revengeful feelings. I
hope he may see the error of his ways, and resolve
to lead an honest life."</p>

<p>"You are too merciful, sir."</p>

<p>"It may be so, but he is young, and there is hope
of his repentance."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Kirby, do I understand that you wish me to
leave you?" asked Dean.</p>

<p>"Yes. You had better get out at the next station.
Here is a dollar. I don't want to leave you altogether
penniless. Of course I must report what has happened
to Squire Bates, who stood sponsor to you."</p>

<p>The train began to slow up, for the next station was
near at hand.</p>

<p>"I don't want the dollar," said Dean. "I understand
your object in accusing me of theft. I could
clear myself now if I chose, but I am willing to
wait."</p>

<p>Dean rose from his seat, and with flushed cheeks
and head erect walked to the end of the car, and
stepped out on the platform. He stood there, and
watched the departure of the train, bearing his late
employer farther West. He did not even know the
name of the station at which he had disembarked.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="small">A FRIEND&mdash;IN NEED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The suddenness with which Dean found himself
cast adrift, and thrown upon his own resources, was
enough to take away his breath. As merchants
from time to time take account of stock, he felt that
it would be wise now that he was about to set up for
himself to ascertain the extent of his means.</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into his pocket, and drew out
a small collection of silver coins and pennies. All
told he found he had but sixty-seven cents, and he
was probably twelve hundred miles from home.
The chances were that it would cost him at least
three cents a mile, or thirty-six dollars, to get back
to Waterford. He would have been glad to have the
thirty-six dollars, but he had no intention of going
back until he could carry something with him. He
did not want to acknowledge that he had made a
failure.</p>

<p>Dean ascertained that the town in which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
stranded (for he hadn't money enough to get out of
it) was Granville. The village appeared to be half
a mile away, and might at a rough guess contain a
thousand inhabitants. Like most small Western
towns, it consisted of one main street, with short side
streets opening out of it. For a place of the size it
seemed to be wide awake, and enterprising, more so
than a village of corresponding population at the
East.</p>

<p>After spending a few minutes at the depot Dean
took his valise, and trudged on in the direction of the
town. What he should do when he got there he
hardly knew. He was ready for anything that
might turn up, and he did not worry as much as he
would if he had been twice as old.</p>

<p>Dean had accomplished about half the distance
when a voice hailed him, "Halloa, youngster!"</p>

<p>Dean turned in the direction of the voice and his
glance fell on a man of perhaps twenty-five, who was
stretched comfortably under a tree by the roadside.
He had a knapsack and wore a velveteen suit.
Something in his appearance gave Dean the impression
that he was an actor.</p>

<p>Responding to his greeting, which was accompanied
by a pleasant smile, Dean answered "Good day!"</p>

<p>"Where are you traveling, young chap?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," responded Dean. "I suppose I
am on my way to the village."</p>

<p>"Do you live about here?"</p>

<p>"No, I live in New York State."</p>

<p>"So do I, when I'm at home, but I'm not often at
home."</p>

<p>"Are you an actor?"</p>

<p>"That's what I call myself. That's what I am
styled by admiring friends, though some of the
critics are unkind enough to express doubts. At present
I am in hard luck. I came West with a dramatic
company which has gone to pieces. I am traveling
homeward on my uppers. Permit me to introduce
myself," and he doffed a soft hat which he wore, "as
Cecil Montgomery, not wholly unknown to the metropolitan
stage."</p>

<p>There was something attractive in his good-humored
recklessness that impressed Dean favorably.</p>

<p>"My name is Dean Dunham," he responded,
"not known on any stage."</p>

<p>"Excuse the impertinence, but are you a young
man of fortune?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you call sixty-seven cents a fortune."</p>

<p>"Dean, my boy, you have ten cents the advantage
of me. If you have any plans that with our united
capital we may be able to carry out, my wealth is at
your service."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no plans except to get something to eat,"
said Dean.</p>

<p>"I am with you there," said the actor, rising with
alacrity from his recumbent position. "Know you
of a hostelry?"</p>

<p>"If that means a restaurant, I think we may find
one in the village."</p>

<p>"Wisely guessed. If you have no objection to
my company, we will walk together."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad of your company, Mr. Montgomery."</p>

<p>"You do me proud, Mr. Dunham," and the actor
once more doffed his hat, and bowed low. "If you
don't mind, my boy, suppose you tell me what brings
you out here, so far from home? I came with a
combination, as I have explained."</p>

<p>"I came as private secretary with a gentleman&mdash;no,
a man named Kirby. He chose to charge me
with stealing his pocket-book, and discharged me on
the train, refusing to pay me back wages."</p>

<p>"Steal&mdash;with that honest face! Why, I'd trust
you with my entire wealth&mdash;fifty-seven cents&mdash;and
wouldn't lose a minute's sleep."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Dean, smiling. "I hope I
deserve your confidence."</p>

<p>"So it seems that we are both in very much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
same plight. We must hustle for a living. I wish
you were an actor."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We might give a joint performance, and so pick
up a few pennies. Can you play on any instrument?"</p>

<p>Dean drew a harmonica from his pocket and displayed
it.</p>

<p>"I can play a little on this," he said.</p>

<p>"Give us a taste of your quality."</p>

<p>Dean put the harmonica in his mouth and played
several popular airs in very creditable style. He had
practiced considerably in Waterford, and when he
left home chanced to bring his favorite instrument
with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Montgomery applauded vociferously.</p>

<p>"That's capital!" he said. "I have an idea. Our
fortune is made."</p>

<p>"Is it? I'm very glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"Let me explain. I am a dramatic Jack of all
trades. I can sing, dance, recite, and give imitations.
Why shouldn't we give a joint exhibition? I
venture to say we can charm and astonish the good
people of Granville, and gather in golden shekels for
ourselves."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Listen. You are the world-renowned Dean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Dunham, the champion player on the harmonica,
who have charmed tens of thousands, and whose
name is a household word from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I shall begin to think I am a humbug."</p>

<p>"So be it! Humbug makes money and rides at
ease, while modest merit goes barefoot and tramps
over dusty roads."</p>

<p>"That is complimentary to us, for it happens to be
our condition just at present."</p>

<p>"Then let us abandon it! It doesn't pay. Will
you join me, and try your luck with the good people
of Granville?"</p>

<p>Dean hesitated a moment, but only a moment.
He must do something, and nothing else seemed to
present itself. If any one chose to pay for the privilege
of hearing him play on the harmonica, he had
no objection to receiving the money. Besides, he
would be at no trouble in the matter. Mr. Montgomery
would make all arrangements, and he would
only have to take the part that might be assigned
him.</p>

<p>"I am at your service, Mr. Montgomery."</p>

<p>"Your hand on it! We will, we must be successful.
In after years, when fame and money are yours,
think that it was I, Cecil Montgomery, who assisted
you to make your d&#233;but."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"I certainly will, Mr. Montgomery," said Dean,
falling into his companion's humor.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the village. A sign
over a small one-story building attracted their attention.</p>


<p class="center in0 p2t p2b"><span class="smcap">Restaurant<br />
and<br />
Coffee House.</span></p>


<p>"Let us enter," said the actor. "It is astonishing
what an appetite I have. If we are to give an entertainment
we must be fed."</p>

<p>Fortunately the prices at the restaurant and coffee
house were very moderate, and the two travelers
were able to make a plentiful meal, though it reduced
their stock of money almost to nothing. After dinner
Mr. Montgomery indulged in a five cent-cigar, but
Dean declined to smoke.</p>

<p>"Stay here, Dean," said his companion. "I hear
there is a weekly paper published in Granville. I
will see the editor, and ask him to join us in the
speculation, sharing the profits. The paper appears
to-morrow. He can give us a big puff that will
insure our success."</p>

<p>"Suppose he won't do it?"</p>

<p>"Leave it to me! I have a most persuasive
tongue. Granville must not let such an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
slip. It must hear me act and listen to your melodious
strains."</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed. Then Montgomery came
back radiant. "It's all fixed," he said. "You make
your d&#233;but to-morrow evening. I have engaged
board at the hotel for us both."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN'S DEBUT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning the <i>Granville Weekly Palladium</i>
appeared, containing a flaming notice of the forthcoming
entertainment, in which the merits of the
two performers were extolled in the highest terms.
Dean opened his eyes in amazement when he read
the following tribute to himself:</p>

<p>At immense expenses the service of</p>


<p class="center in0 p2t p2b">DEAN DUNHAM</p>


<p class="in0">the Champion Harmonica player of America have
been secured. This young performer, still only a
boy in years, will spend the next season in Europe,
having been offered engagements in London, Paris
and Vienna, and he is now playing a farewell series
of engagements in his native land. Probably the
citizens of Granville may never again have the opportunity
of hearing him.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you say to that, Dean, my boy?" asked
Montgomery, nudging him in the side.</p>

<p>"It makes me feel foolish, Mr. Montgomery," said
Dean, blushing. "If it should be read in Waterford
the people would never get through laughing at
me."</p>

<p>"They won't read it, my boy, unless it turns out
true."</p>

<p>"Turns out true?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I believe you can win popularity by your
playing. We can tell better this time to-morrow.
If you do, how can we tell but the rest may also come
true?"</p>

<p>"If it were the violin or the banjo! But a little
cheap harmonica!"</p>

<p>"Never mind what the instrument is if you know
how to handle it. Now let me tell you one thing
that will encourage you: I think we are going to
have a big house."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"There hasn't been an entertainment in Granville
for several weeks. The people are hungry to be
amused. They patronize performances like ours
much better in the West than at the East. There the
people are more humdrum and steady going. Here
they are more excitable. Now I am going to give
you a hint. Take a walk out into the woods, or anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
where you will be alone, and practice popular
songs. I want you to make a sensation this evening."</p>

<p>"It seems ridiculous, my playing for money!"</p>

<p>"How much money have you in your pocket?"</p>

<p>"Five cents."</p>

<p>"Then it strikes me it would be more ridiculous
<i>not</i> playing for money. Whatever talents we possess
our Creator meant us to exercise for our benefit
and the pleasure of the community."</p>

<p>"At any rate I'll do my best."</p>

<p>"Then you'll do all I ask. By the way, I am
going to have you take the tickets this evening, up
to the time of the performance. It will save money,
and draw public attention."</p>

<p>"I can do that, at any rate."</p>

<p>During the forenoon Dean went to a secluded
place a mile from the village, and began to practice
on the harmonica. He had a quick ear, and was
really an excellent performer. He was unaware that
he had an audience till a boy attracted his attention
peeping from behind a tree at a little distance.</p>

<p>Dean nodded and smiled, and the boy was encouraged
to come forward.</p>

<p>"Are you Dean Dunham, the boy that's going to
be at the concert?" asked the young auditor, bashfully.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How long have you played?"</p>

<p>"Four or five years."</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Almost sixteen."</p>

<p>"What lots of money you must have made!"</p>

<p>Dean smiled. He thought it most prudent not to
speak definitely on this point. He was rather curious
to know what the boy thought of his playing.</p>

<p>"Can you play on the harmonica?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only a little. Of course I can't play like you."</p>

<p>"Do you like my playing, then?"</p>

<p>"You play bully."</p>

<p>Dean was gratified, not so much out of vanity, as
because it encouraged him to think that others also
might regard his performance with favor.</p>

<p>"I am glad you like it," he said. "Are you going
to the entertainment this evening?"</p>

<p>"I should like to," said the boy, wistfully, "but I
don't have much money to spend. I have to work
for a living."</p>

<p>"He little thinks that I am worse off than he,"
thought Dean. "He has a home, while I am over a
thousand miles from mine, and with only five cents
in my pocket."</p>

<p>"It won't cost you anything to come in," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
in a friendly manner. "I shall be at the door, and
I will let you in free."</p>

<p>"Will you, really?" queried the boy, overjoyed.</p>

<p>"Certainly I will. I shall remember your face.
If I don't, just remind me of my promise."</p>

<p>As a matter of business, Dean's offer of a free
ticket proved a stroke of policy. The boy spread
among his comrades a highly colored report of Dean's
wonderful performance on the harmonica, and the
result was a large attendance of young people in the
evening.</p>

<p>When Dean took his place at the door he found
himself the object of many wondering and curious
glances, and he was at first abashed; but finally,
reminding himself that he was among strangers who
were disposed to look upon him as a genius, he accommodated
himself to the position, and applied
himself assiduously to his duties.</p>

<p>The hall in which the entertainment was to take
place contained about four hundred people. When
eight o'clock struck it was packed, many having
come from neighboring towns. The price of admission
was thirty-five cents for adults, and twenty-five
for children. It was clear, therefore, that the receipts
must be considerably over a hundred dollars.
The rent of the hall being but ten dollars, this allowed
a large margin for profit.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>Punctually at eight o'clock the entertainment commenced
with a brief introductory speech from Mr.
Montgomery.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen and ladies," he said, "it has long
been the desire of Mr. Dunham and myself to appear
in your beautiful village, and at length our
wishes are to be gratified. We shall do our utmost
to please you, and if we fail, think that it is our
ability and not our will that is lacking. I will commence
with a humorous recitation, in the character
of an old darky."</p>

<p>He disappeared behind the screen, and emerged in
a very short time disguised as a Southern negro.</p>

<p>This impersonation hit the popular taste. It was
followed by a song, and then Mr. Montgomery introduced
Dean in a highly flattering manner.</p>

<p>Dean appeared with a flushed face, and a momentary
feeling of trepidation. Making a bow to the
audience, he struck up the favorite melody of the
day. He really played very well, the excitement of
playing before an audience helping rather than interfering
with him, and his performance was greeted
with hearty and long continued applause. At Mr.
Montgomery's suggestion he gratified the audience
with an encore. Among those who applauded loudest
was the boy to whom he had given free admission.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>"You have done yourself proud, Dean, my boy,"
said Montgomery, when Dean retired behind the
screen. "Our entertainment is a success. Our
audience is good-natured."</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking how the folks at home
would be surprised if they knew I was performing in
public," said Dean, smiling.</p>

<p>"And making money out of it. That's where the
best part comes in. Follow up your success, my
boy. I shall go out twice and then call on you
again."</p>

<p>The next time Dean appeared with confidence,
being satisfied that the audience were friendly. His
second appearance was equally satisfactory, and he
was compelled to blush when he overheard one
school-girl on the front row of benches whisper to
another, "Isn't he sweet?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me I am learning a good deal about
myself," thought Dean. "I must take care not to
get conceited."</p>

<p>The dual entertainment lasted about an hour and
a half, Mr. Montgomery of course using up the lion's
share of the time. At last it concluded, and Dean
and his companion gathered up the money and
went home. The profits over and above expenses
amounted to eighty dollars, of which the editor, according
to the agreement, received forty per cent, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
thirty-two dollars. The remainder, forty-eight dollars,
was divided equally between Dean and Mr.
Montgomery. As the hotel charge was but a dollar
a day for each, they felt handsomely compensated
for their exertions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN LOSES HIS PARTNER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When the two partners returned to the hotel with
the proceeds of the entertainment in their pockets,
they were in high spirits.</p>

<p>"I feel as rich as Vanderbilt," said Montgomery
in exultation.</p>

<p>"And I feel like an Astor or a Gould," chimed in
Dean. "Peter Kirby did me a good turn when he
discharged me."</p>

<p>"Dean, you are star! I had no idea of your
talent."</p>

<p>"Don't flatter me, Mr. Montgomery," said Dean
blushing. "You will make me self-conceited. I
was lucky in falling in with you."</p>

<p>"Well said, my boy! I see you don't grudge me
my share of the credit. We will keep on, will we
not?"</p>

<p>"As long as there is any money in it."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Your hand on that."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>In pursuance of this agreement, three evenings
later they gave an entertainment in the town of
Cameron, twenty miles away. Circumstances were
not as favorable, but they divided twenty dollars net
profits.</p>

<p>"We mustn't complain of that, Dean," said his
companion. "It isn't as much, to be sure, as we
made at Granville."</p>

<p>"But it seems to me ridiculously large for the
little I did, Mr. Montgomery."</p>

<p>"You are modest, Dean. That is not artistic.
You must set a proper value on your talent."</p>

<p>"I think I do," said Dean, smiling. "I feel very
much like a humbug, Mr. Montgomery. A young
lady came up to me last evening and asked me if I
had played before any of the crowned heads of
Europe, and if I were personally acquainted with
Queen Victoria."</p>

<p>"I hope you told her you were."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Montgomery, I shouldn't be willing to
tell such a falsehood."</p>

<p>"All business, my dear boy, all business! We
must blow our own trumpets if we want to be appreciated.
By the way, what did you tell her?"</p>

<p>"That I had not yet played before the queen, but
should I go to England, and could arrange to do so,
I would."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good! You kept up appearances. What
did she say?"</p>

<p>"She asked me if I would get her Queen Victoria's
autograph, in that case. She also asked me for my
own. I promised her the queen's if I were able to
obtain it."</p>

<p>"Didn't she ask for <i>my</i> autograph?" asked
Mr. Montgomery, with a twinge of professional jealousy.</p>

<p>"She said she was going to ask you for it."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to gratify her," said Montgomery,
condescendingly. "I am often asked for an
autograph."</p>

<p>"That was my first application," said Dean smiling.</p>

<p>"You are not as old as I. Long before you are,
your autograph will be in demand."</p>

<p>For three weeks the combination continued to give
entertainments, arranging from two to three a week.
They did not again meet with the success which had
greeted them at Granville, but in almost every case
they made expenses, and a fair sum besides. At the
end of this time, each of the partners found himself
possessed of about forty dollars.</p>

<p>At the close of a concert at a small town in
Missouri, on returning to the hotel, Mr. Montgomery
chanced to take up a copy of the New York <i>Herald</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
in the office. He ran over the advertisements on the
first page, including the "Personals," when all at
once his color changed, and he looked agitated.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mr. Montgomery?" asked
Dean.</p>

<p>"Bad news, my boy!" said the actor sadly.
"Look at that!"</p>

<p>Dean read the following among the personals:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="drop in0"><span class="uppercase">CECIL</span> MONTGOMERY, <span class="smcap">Jr.</span> Come home at once! Your
mother is very sick.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"My poor old mother!" said the actor feelingly.
"She may be dead by this time. Why couldn't I
have seen this notice before?"</p>

<p>"What is the date of the paper?" asked Dean.</p>

<p>"It is five days old."</p>

<p>"I suppose you will go at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, I must. I never would forgive myself if I
did not hurry home on the chance of seeing the dear
old mother once more."</p>

<p>"You are right, Mr. Montgomery. I would do
the same if I were fortunate enough to have a mother
living."</p>

<p>"Of course that ends our partnership for the present.
Will you go home with me, Dean?"</p>

<p>Dean shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, I have nothing to go home to. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
take all my money, and there would be nothing for
me to do in Waterford."</p>

<p>"But you can't give entertainments alone."</p>

<p>"I can make my living somehow. I have forty
dollars, and that would last me some time even if I
got nothing to do."</p>

<p>When Dean bade his companion good-bye at the
station the next morning, and turned away, a forlorn
feeling came over him, and he felt tempted to take
the next train East himself. But the thought of going
back to Waterford as poor as he started, and with no
prospect of employment, braced him up, and he resolved
to push on westward and take his chances.
He returned to the hotel, and sat down to consider
his plans.</p>

<p>There a pleasant surprise awaited him.</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman to see you, Mr. Dunham,"
said the clerk.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Dean.</p>

<p>"He went out to make a call in the village but will
be back in fifteen minutes. This is his card."</p>

<p>Dean took the card in his hand, and read the
name</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Samuel Gunnison</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"Any acquaintance of yours?" asked the clerk.</p>

<p>"No; I never heard the name."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>"I think he wants you to play to-morrow evening.
He lives in the next town, Carterville."</p>

<p>"Mr. Montgomery has been called East. I am
afraid this will stop our entertainments."</p>

<p>"He did not ask for Mr. Montgomery, only for
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Gunnison soon came in. He was a slender,
dark complexioned man, with a pleasant face.</p>

<p>"I know you are Dean Dunham," he said, extending
his hand, "for I heard you play last evening.
Are you engaged for to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I should like to engage your services. An
entertainment is to be given in our town hall for the
benefit of our town library. For the most part local
talent is employed. We are to have a short play,
and a few songs. I, as manager, have thought it
would help us if we could advertise you in connection
with the home attractions."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to make an engagement," said
Dean pleasantly.</p>

<p>"What would be your terms?" asked Mr. Gunnison
a little anxiously.</p>

<p>"How much can you afford to pay me?" asked
Dean.</p>

<p>"We would not think of offering a player of your
reputation less than ten dollars if it were not desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
to make expenses as small as possible, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances," said Dean, interrupting
him, "I will be willing to come for five."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Dunham. You are very kind,"
said Mr. Gunnison, warmly, grasping our hero by
the hand. "I will try to make it up to you. Instead
of going to the hotel you shall be my guest, and your
expenses will be nothing. If you are ready I will
take you over at once. I have a buggy at the door."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, I will accept your kind invitation."</p>

<p>So Dean, feeling less lonesome than he did, secured
his valise, and taking a seat beside his new
friend, rode in the direction of Carterville. He was
destined to meet an old acquaintance there.</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="small">AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Gunnison had several children, including one
boy of about Dean's age, who was disposed at first
to regard our hero with distant respect as a professional
star, but soon became intimate with him on
finding that Dean had the same tastes as himself.
This appeared to surprise him.</p>

<p>"I say," he remarked, "I thought you wouldn't
have anything to say to a fellow like me."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Dean, innocently.</p>

<p>"Oh, because you're a big gun."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"You give concerts, and have your name in the
papers."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Dean smiling, "I have to do that for
a living, you know. I'm only a boy after all."</p>

<p>"And do you like to play baseball?"</p>

<p>"I only wish I had a chance."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Gus Gunnison, brightening up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
"Well, our club is going to play the Resolutes from
the next town this afternoon. We are one man
short. Will you take his place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall be glad to."</p>

<p>"What place do you prefer?"</p>

<p>"I'll take any you choose to give me."</p>

<p>"Can you catch?"</p>

<p>"I like it better than anything else."</p>

<p>"Then that's settled. Come over and I'll show
you the ground, and introduce you to some of the
fellows."</p>

<p>When the members of the Carterville club learned
that the famous young musician, Dean Dunham, had
agreed to play on their side, they were very much
elated. There was, however, a slight uneasiness lest
he should not prove a skillful player, as they were
eager to beat their visitors. A little practice playing,
however, showed them that Dean was quite equal to
any one in their club, and they became eager for the
fray.</p>

<p>Dean did not disappoint them. He entered into
the game with enthusiasm, and played with unusual
skill, so that the Resolutes were beaten by a score
of 18 to 8, and the victory was largely attributed to
the good playing of the new catcher, who proved
equally good in batting.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>The members of the club came up and tendered
their thanks to Dean.</p>

<p>"If you can play on the harmonica as well as you
can play ball," said Gus Gunnison, "you'll do. Our
club will attend the entertainment in a body, and
hear you."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't be disappointed," said Dean
smiling.</p>

<p>Evening came, and Dean was called upon to play
at four different points in the entertainment. On the
front seats just facing him were the members of the
Active Baseball Club. Dean nodded to them from
the platform, and they felt proud of such a public
recognition.</p>

<p>Dean was stimulated to do his best, as he did not
wish his new friends to be disappointed. During the
day he practiced "Home, Sweet Home" with variations,
partly original, partly remembered from a performance
to which he had listened at a public entertainment
a year or two previous. His efforts were
crowned with success. The applause, led by the
members of the Active club, was tumultuous, and
Dean was compelled to repeat his performance.</p>

<p>He did so, but towards the close he nearly broke
down in consequence of a surprising discovery that
he made. In looking round the audience, not far
from the center aisle his glance chanced to fall upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
a face which he had the best cause to remember.</p>

<p>It was no other than Mr. Peter Kirby, whose
presence will be afterwards explained.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirby on his part was even more amazed to
find the country boy whom he had left to his own
resources emerging in such a conspicuous manner
into public notice. He had thought of Dean as
wandering about the country a forlorn and penniless
tramp, begging for charity. How on earth he had
managed to achieve the position of a musical star
performer he could not imagine.</p>

<p>"That boy is getting dangerous," thought he.
"If the captain knew of his success he would feel
very nervous."</p>

<p>Mr. Kirby was in Carterville as the guest of Dr.
Sidney Thorp, a wealthy gentleman, into whose good
graces he had ingratiated himself at a hotel where
they chanced to meet. He had accepted Dr. Thorp's
invitation to spend a couple of days at his house,
with the intention of robbing his hospitable entertainer
if he should have the opportunity.</p>

<p>"A remarkable young performer!" said Dr. Thorp,
as Dean closed his playing.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Kirby absently. "How does he
happen to be here?"</p>

<p>"He had been giving an entertainment in a town
near by, in connection with a variety actor. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
committee, finding that he gave satisfaction, invited
him to play here this evening."</p>

<p>"Do you pay him anything?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Dr. Thorp, with surprise.
"We couldn't expect to obtain a performer of so
much talent gratuitously."</p>

<p>Kirby opened his eyes in surprise at hearing his
quondam secretary spoken of in such terms.</p>

<p>"Do you know how much he is to be paid?"</p>

<p>"I believe he agreed to come for five dollars, considering
that the entertainment was for a charitable
purpose."</p>

<p>Kirby could scarcely refrain from whistling, so
great was his surprise.</p>

<p>He recognized Dean some time before his former
secretary's glance fell upon him. Dean's start
showed that the recognition was mutual.</p>

<p>"I am going to speak to this boy&mdash;Dean Dunham,"
said he to Dr. Thorp, when the entertainment
was at an end.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gunnison will introduce you. Shall I ask
him?"</p>

<p>"I need no introduction. The boy and I have
met."</p>

<p>Dean was standing on the platform watching the
departing audience, when he saw Mr. Kirby approaching.
He felt a little nervous, not knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
what the intentions of his old employer might be.</p>

<p>Kirby paused a moment, and a peculiar smile
overspread his countenance.</p>

<p>"I presume you remember me?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dean, coldly.</p>

<p>"I am rather surprised to meet you again under
such circumstances."</p>

<p>"I am rather surprised myself&mdash;at the circumstances."</p>

<p>"You have become quite a star!" said Kirby with
a sneer.</p>

<p>Dean answered gravely, "I had to make a living
in some way. It was an accident, my trying this
way."</p>

<p>"Would you like to return to me&mdash;as my secretary?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Kirby, I prefer to travel independently."</p>

<p>"Suppose I should tell why I discharged you?
That might prove inconvenient to you."</p>

<p>"Then I should have a story to tell that might
prove inconvenient to you, Mr. Kirby."</p>

<p>Dean looked Kirby straight in the face, and the
latter saw that he no longer had an inexperienced
country boy to deal with, but one who might prove
dangerous to his plans.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>"On the whole," he said, after a pause, "suppose
we both keep silence as to the past."</p>

<p>"I will do so, unless I should have occasion to
speak."</p>

<p>No one was near enough to listen to this conversation.
Now Dr. Thorp came up, and Kirby said
with an abrupt turn of the conversation, "I am glad
to have met you again, my young friend. I wish
you success."</p>

<p>Dean bowed gravely, but didn't speak. He was
not prepared to wish success to Peter Kirby, knowing
what he did of him.</p>

<p>During the evening Dr. Thorp called at the house
of Mr. Gunnison, but unaccompanied by his guest.
Dean had heard meanwhile at whose house Kirby
was staying, and he felt that he ought to drop a hint
that would put the unsuspecting host on his guard.
He finally decided that it was his duty to do so.</p>

<p>"May I speak with you a moment in private, Dr.
Thorp?" he asked, as the guest arose to go.</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered the doctor, in some surprise.</p>

<p>Dean accompanied him into the hall.</p>

<p>"Do you know much of the gentleman who is
staying at your house?" asked Dean.</p>

<p>"No; why do you ask?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I have reason to think that he is a
professional thief."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! What do you mean!"</p>

<p>Dean briefly recounted the robberies of which he
was himself cognizant, adding that he gave this information
in strict confidence. "I thought I ought
to put you on your guard," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Dunham," said Dr. Thorp,
warmly. "You have done me a great service. I
happen to have a considerable sum in money and
bonds at my house. I shall look out for Mr. Kirby,"
he added, with a grim nod.</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="small">DR. THORP'S CABINET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dr. Thorp had been pleased with Peter Kirby,
who had laid himself out to be agreeable, and the
doctor was far from suspecting his real character.
When this was revealed to him by Dean, he quickly
decided to test it for himself.</p>

<p>Some men, inclined to be nervous and timid,
would have had their apprehensions excited, and
dreaded an encounter with a professional criminal.
But Dr. Thorp was cool, resolute and determined.
He proposed to facilitate Kirby's designs, and catch
him in a trap.</p>

<p>When he reached home he found Kirby smoking
on the piazza.</p>

<p>"Have you been taking a walk, Doctor?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dr. Thorp. "I made a call on
a neighbor. I hope you have not been lonesome."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Your daughter has enabled me to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the time pleasantly. But I am glad to see you
back."</p>

<p>Had Kirby known that Dr. Thorp had had an interview
with Dean Dunham, his anxiety would have
been excited.</p>

<p>"By the way, Doctor," said Kirby with apparent
carelessness, "I have a little money to invest. Can
you recommend any form of investment?"</p>

<p>"You might buy a house in the village and settle
down. I believe the next estate is for sale."</p>

<p>"It would certainly be an inducement to become
your neighbor," said Kirby politely, "but I am a
rolling stone. I am always traveling. I couldn't
content myself in any one place, not even in a large
city."</p>

<p>"I suspect your mode of life makes frequent
removals necessary," thought Dr. Thorp, though he
did not say so.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't care to invest in real estate,"
he said a moment later, "you might purchase government
bonds or railroad securities."</p>

<p>"To which do you give the preference?" asked
Kirby.</p>

<p>The doctor smiled inwardly. He saw that Kirby
was trying to ascertain whether he had any negotiable
securities in his possession, but he was ready to
play into his hands.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I think well of both."</p>

<p>"I had some government bonds at one time,"
said Kirby, "but they were stolen. That has made
me cautious."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you were careless."</p>

<p>"No doubt I was. I kept them in a trunk at my
boarding-house. I presume you wouldn't venture,
even in a quiet village like this, to keep bonds in
your house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we never receive visits from thieves or
burglars. I don't consider trunks so safe as&mdash;that
cabinet."</p>

<p>He pointed to a black walnut cabinet with several
drawers standing in one corner of the room.</p>

<p>Kirby's face lighted up. He had got the information
he desired, but he resumed his indifferent
manner.</p>

<p>"I think you are right," he said. "Besides, in a
town like Carterville, as you say, thieves are hardly
likely to be found."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no!" said Dr. Thorp yawning. "I
have no occasion to borrow trouble on that score."</p>

<p>"Living as I generally do in large cities where
members of the criminal class abound," said Kirby,
"I am naturally more suspicious than you. I confess
I wish I lived in a place of Arcadian innocence
like this."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Thorp smiled. He was amused to hear one
whom he believed to be a professional thief discourse
in this manner.</p>

<p>"You might find it dull," he said, a little satirically,
"It would lack the spice and excitement of wickedness."</p>

<p>At a little after eleven Kirby signified that he was
tired and was conducted to his bed-chamber. Dr.
Thorp remained behind, and opening the lower drawer
of his cabinet removed therefrom a roll of bank bills
and a five hundred dollar government bond.</p>

<p>"I think these will be safe in my trunk to-night,"
he said to himself. "Now, Mr. Kirby, you can explore
the cabinet at your leisure. I doubt if you will
find enough to repay you for your trouble."</p>

<p>Kirby occupied a chamber just over the sitting-room.
He didn't undress himself, but threw himself
on the bed to snatch a little rest.</p>

<p>"I found out very cleverly where the doctor kept
his bonds," he soliloquized. "He is an innocent,
unsuspicious man, luckily for me. So no thieves or
burglars ever visit Carterville," he repeated with a
soft laugh. "The good doctor would have been
mightily surprised had he known the character of the
man with whom he was talking. It is hardly a credit
to take in a simple-minded man like the doctor. I
very much regret the necessity of repaying his hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
as I shall, but I need the bonds more than he
does."</p>

<p>Kirby did not allow himself to sleep. There was
important work to be done, and he must not run the
risk of oversleeping himself.</p>

<p>He waited impatiently till he heard the public
clock strike midnight, then taking off his shoes descended
in his stocking feet to the sitting-room.
There stood the cabinet plainly visible in the glorious
moonlight that flooded the room, making artificial
light unnecessary.</p>

<p>"It's an easy job for a man of my experience to
open it," thought Kirby. "I hope the doctor is
sound asleep. He looks like a man who is safe to
sleep all night."</p>

<p>From his pocket he produced a bunch of skeleton
keys, which he at once set himself to use. The lock
on the drawer of the cabinet was a simple one, presenting
no difficulty, and in less than five minutes he
opened the upper drawer. A glance satisfied him that
it contained nothing that he could make available.
In turn he opened the other drawers, with equal ill
success.</p>

<p>"The doctor must have fooled me!" he muttered
impatiently, "or is there some secret drawer that I
have overlooked?"</p>

<p>This question he asked himself, but he was far from
expecting an answer.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"You have examined the cabinet pretty thoroughly
Mr. Kirby," said a cool, calm voice.</p>

<p>Kirby sprang to his feet in wild dismay. There,
looking at him from the doorway, was Dr. Thorp,
his host, whom he was conspiring to rob.</p>

<p>"You are an early riser, are you not, Mr. Kirby?"
said the doctor composedly.</p>

<p>Kirby quickly decided upon his course.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked, passing his hand over
his face in a bewildered way.</p>

<p>"Where are you? Don't you recognize the room?
A more pertinent query would be, 'What are you
doing?'"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" ejaculated Kirby&mdash;"I&mdash;I see
it now. That unfortunate habit of walking in my
sleep! What can you think of me?"</p>

<p>"Do you generally carry skeleton keys about with
you when you walk in your sleep, Mr. Kirby?"
asked the doctor pointedly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I really don't know how to explain," stammered
Kirby. "These keys I found in my room on
the morning after I was robbed. I took them with
me, thinking they might be of use if I should lose
my regular keys."</p>

<p>"Very ingeniously explained, upon my word!"</p>

<p>"It isn't possible, Dr. Thorp, that you really take
me for a thief! I hope you have more confidence
in me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it really did occur to me that you were a
professional burglar. Your last words which I overheard
before intruding upon you seem to bear out
that supposition."</p>

<p>"What were they?"</p>

<p>"'<i>Is there some secret drawer that I have overlooked?</i>'
Perhaps you will do me the favor to explain
them."</p>

<p>"I can't. They were spoken unconsciously, I
assure you. This habit of walking in my sleep has
got me into trouble several times before."</p>

<p>"Then take my advice and discontinue it."</p>

<p>"I will. I should have asked you to lock me in
my chamber if I could have foreseen what has happened."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kirby," said Dr. Thorp sternly, "you must
think I am a simpleton to be taken in by such a transparent
falsehood. I was deceived in you, I admit,
but now I understand your real character. I won't
have you arrested, though I ought, but I require you
to leave my house at once."</p>

<p>"In the middle of the night?" said Kirby in dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes. I cannot agree to shelter you even for the
balance of the night."</p>

<p>"Tell me one thing," said Kirby, changing his
tone; "did any one put you on your guard against
me?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It was Dean Dunham."</p>

<p>"You can form your own conclusions."</p>

<p>"That is all you need tell me. I understand it all.
I will go to my room and secure my luggage, and
then bid you good-bye."</p>

<p>"I will wait for you."</p>

<p>"I owe you another debt, Dean Dunham!" said
Kirby, as he left the house with the pleasant prospect
of a sleepless night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="small">THE LONELY CABIN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dean had left the breakfast-table the next morning,
and was considering what would be the next stage
of his journey when Dr. Thorp was announced.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dunham," he said, "I have come to thank
you for your warning of last evening."</p>

<p>"I hope it was of service to you, sir."</p>

<p>"It was of essential service. Your old acquaintance
had planned to rob me of a sum of money and
a quantity of government bonds, but being on my
guard I was able to frustrate his designs."</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" asked Mr. Gunnison, his
curiosity excited.</p>

<p>"In the middle of the night, or rather a little after
midnight, I heard some one going downstairs softly.
I followed unobserved, and caught my guest opening
the drawers in my cabinet."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>"I ordered him out of the house. He stood not
upon the order of his going, but went at once. Where
he is now I cannot inform you, but presume he has
placed several miles between himself and Carterville.
Fortunately he went empty-handed, and my money
and bonds are still in my possession. But for our
young friend here I should hardly be able to say
that."</p>

<p>"You are indebted to me for bringing him to Carterville,
Dr. Thorp," said Mr. Gunnison in a jocular
tone. "How much are you going to allow me?"</p>

<p>"You are amply repaid by his services," said the
doctor, "judging from the comments I have heard
upon his performance. I am under obligations to
him, however, which I ought to acknowledge. Mr.
Dunham," he continued, taking from his pocket a
small gold watch and chain, "I see you have no
watch. Please accept this with my best wishes."</p>

<p>It was an Elgin gold watch of neat pattern which
he offered to Dean.</p>

<p>"It is not quite new," proceeded the doctor. "I
bought it of a young man in need of money, and
having paid him its full value I have no scruple in
giving it away."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Dean, his face showing
the satisfaction he felt. "I have felt the need of
a watch ever since I began to travel, but never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
dreamed of anything better than a silver one. I shall
be very proud of this one."</p>

<p>"And I am very glad to give it to you. In what
direction do you propose to journey!"</p>

<p>"Westward, sir. I haven't any very clear ideas
further than that."</p>

<p>"Shall you go as far as Colorado?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I think so."</p>

<p>"I have a nephew out there somewhere&mdash;Henry
Thorp&mdash;a young man of twenty-five. He is probably
mining, but I don't know his location. Should you
run across him, ask him to communicate with me.
His aunt and myself will be glad to hear from him."</p>

<p>"I will not forget it, sir," said Dean, though he
thought it quite improbable that he and the nephew
referred to would ever meet.</p>

<p>Dr. Thorp took his leave, and Dean soon after took
leave of the Gunnison family. He was pressed to
remain and play another game of baseball, but felt
that he could not spare the time.</p>

<p>A week later found Dean only a hundred miles
farther on his way. He might have accomplished
this distance on the cars in a few hours, but he preferred
to make a leisurely trip, looking out for a
chance to earn money on the way. But after a
season of prosperity a dull time had come to him.
During the week he did not make a single dollar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
He encountered several fair-sized towns, but did not
feel able to give an entire entertainment himself.
His stock of money dwindled, and he began to feel
anxious.</p>

<p>Towards nightfall he found himself apparently at
a distance from any town, and began to feel some
solicitude as to where he could pass the night. It
was a mountain region, and the day seemed to be
shorter than on the plains. The air was chilly, and
Dean felt that it would be dangerous to spend the
night out of doors.</p>

<p>In this emergency he was pleased to descry a rough
cabin a hundred feet from the road.</p>

<p>"There is shelter at any rate if they will take me
In," thought Dean. "I will take care not to wander
into such a wild region again."</p>

<p>He went up to the door, and knocked with his bare
knuckles.</p>

<p>He heard a shuffling noise inside, and an old
woman, with gray hair, unconfined and hanging
loose like a horse's mane, faced him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she inquired abruptly.</p>

<p>"A traveler," answered Dean.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I have lost my way. Can you let me stay here
all night?"</p>

<p>"This isn't a tavern," she responded in a surly
tone.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose not, but I am willing to pay for supper
and a lodging. I don't see any other house near by,
or I would not trouble you."</p>

<p>The old woman eyed him with a curious scrutiny
which made him vaguely uncomfortable, so weird
and uncanny was her look.</p>

<p>"Have you got any money?" she asked at last.</p>

<p>"A little," answered Dean, growing suddenly
cautious.</p>

<p>"Well, you can come in," she said after a pause.</p>

<p>Dean entered, and cast a glance about him.</p>

<p>The cabin was certainly a primitive one. What
furniture it contained seemed home made, put together
awkwardly with such material as came to
hand. In place of chairs were two boxes such as
are used to contain shoes, placed bottom up. There
was a small stove, the heat of which seemed grateful
to the chilly young traveler.</p>

<p>"It is cold," remarked Dean, by way of opening
the conversation.</p>

<p>"Humph!" answered the woman. "Have you
come all the way to tell me that?"</p>

<p>"Evidently the old woman isn't sociable," thought
Dean.</p>

<p>"Where do you live when you're to home?" asked
the woman after a pause.</p>

<p>"In New York State."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you come out here for?"</p>

<p>"I had my living to make," answered Dean, feeling
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"I haven't found any, and I've lived here goin' on
ten years. I suppose you want some supper," she
continued ungraciously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am very hungry. I am sorry to put you
to any trouble."</p>

<p>The woman did not answer, but going to a rude
pantry took out a plate of meat, and some dry bread.
The former she put in the oven, and proceeded to
brew some tea.</p>

<p>Dean watched her preparations with eager interest.
It seemed to him that he had never been so hungry.
He had probably walked ten miles over a rough path,
and the exercise had tired him as much as twice the
distance on the plain. Besides he had his valise with
him, and had found it decidedly an incumbrance.</p>

<p>From time to time the old woman paused in her
preparations and eyed him searchingly. What it was
that attracted her attention Dean could not guess till
she suddenly pointed to his chain, and asked, "Is
there a watch at the end of that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dean with a sudden feeling of
apprehension.</p>

<p>"Let me look at it."</p>

<p>Reluctantly he drew out the watch, and into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
woman's eyes crept a covetous gleam, as she advanced
and took it in her hand.</p>

<p>"It's pretty," she said. "What's it worth?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Dean. "I didn't buy
it. It was a present to me."</p>

<p>"It ought to be worth a good sum."</p>

<p>"I value it because it was given me by a friend,"
said Dean hurriedly.</p>

<p>"We've got nothing to tell time by," said the
woman, slowly, still eying the watch with a fixed
look, "except the sun."</p>

<p>Dean did not reply.</p>

<p>"How do you wind it up?" asked the woman
after a pause. "Do you have a key?"</p>

<p>"No; it's a stem-winder."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I will show you," and Dean wound the watch as
far as it would go.</p>

<p>"I never saw the like of that," said his hostess
with a look of mingled curiosity and surprise.</p>

<p>She released her hold upon the watch, and Dean
put it back in his pocket, rather relieved to have
recovered possession of it again.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the meal was ready, such as it
was.</p>

<p>"Set up," said the woman.</p>

<p>Dean obeyed with alacrity.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>He tasted the meat. It was not unpleasant, but the
taste was peculiar.</p>

<p>"What kind of meat is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"B'ar meat."</p>

<p>"Are there bears in these mountains?"</p>

<p>"Yes; my son killed this one. He's killed many
a b'ar, Dan has. He's a master hand with the rifle.
There's none that can beat him."</p>

<p>"Isn't it dangerous to tackle a bear?"</p>

<p>"No; the b'ars a nat'rally timorous animal. I've
killed more'n one myself."</p>

<p>As Dean surveyed his hostess, he thought her quite
capable of encountering a bear. Her walk and air
were masculine, and there seemed nothing feminine
about her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="small">DAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dean did not allow his speculations as to his
hostess to interfere with his appetite, but he ate with
an enjoyment which he had seldom before felt the
food set before him.</p>

<p>"'Pears to me you've got a right smart appetite,"
said the woman.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said Dean, frankly. "I don't know
when I have been so hungry. I am ashamed of my
appetite, but I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Young folks is mostly hungry," said the woman.</p>

<p>"Especially when they have such nice things set
before them."</p>

<p>The woman, rough as she was, seemed pleased by
this tribute to her culinary skill.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't be afraid to eat all you want
to," she said encouragingly.</p>

<p>Dean took her at her word, and when he rose from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
the table, he had made way with a large share of the
repast provided.</p>

<p>It had grown quite dark in the deepening shadows
of the hills, but it was a twilight darkness, not the
darkness of midnight.</p>

<p>"I think I will go out and take a walk," said Dean,
turning to his hostess.</p>

<p>"You'll come back?" she asked with apparent
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Yes, for I don't want to sleep out of doors. I
can settle for my supper now if you wish."</p>

<p>"No, you can wait till morning."</p>

<p>"Very well!"</p>

<p>Dean left the house, and walked some distance
over the mountain road. Finally, being a little
fatigued from his day's travel and the hearty supper
he had eaten, he lay down under a tree, and enjoyed
the luxury of rest on a full stomach.</p>

<p>In the stillness of the woods it was possible to
hear even a sound ordinarily indistinct. Gradually
Dean became sensible of a peculiar noise which
seemed like the distant murmur of voices. He looked
about him in all directions, but failed to understand
from what the voices proceeded. It seemed almost
as if the sounds came from below. Yet this seemed
absurd.</p>

<p>"There can't be any mine about here," reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Dean. "If there were, I could understand a little
better about the sounds."</p>

<p>Certainly it was not a very likely place for a mine.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I am dreaming," thought Dean.</p>

<p>He rubbed his eyes, and satisfied himself that he
was as much awake as he ever was in his life.</p>

<p>He got up and walked around, looking inquisitively
about him, in the hope of localizing the sound.
Suddenly it stopped, and all was complete silence.
Then he was quite at a loss.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it means. I may as well lie
down and rest again. I imagine my landlady won't
care about seeing me before it is time to go to bed."</p>

<p>With this thought Dean dismissed his conjectures,
and gave himself up to a pleasant reverie. He didn't
worry, though his prospects were not of the best.
He was nearly out of money, and there appeared no
immediate prospect of earning more. Where he was
he did not know, except that he was somewhere
among the mountains of Colorado.</p>

<p>"I wish I could come across some mining settlement,"
thought Dean. "I couldn't buy a claim, but
I could perhaps hire out to some miner, and after a
while get rich enough to own one myself."</p>

<p>Suddenly his reflections were broken in upon by a
discordant voice.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you, youngster, and where did you drop
from?"</p>

<p>Looking up quickly, Dean's glance fell upon a
rough-looking man, in hunting costume considerably
the worse for wear, with a slouched hat on his head,
and a rifle in his hand. The man's face was far from
prepossessing, and his manner did not strike Dean as
friendly.</p>

<p>"My name is Dean Dunham," he said in answer
to the first question, then paused.</p>

<p>"How came you here?"</p>

<p>"I am traveling."</p>

<p>"Where from?"</p>

<p>"New York State."</p>

<p>"What brings a boy like you so far from home?
Is there anyone with you?" demanded the man suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No; I wish there was. I had a companion, but
he got a call to go home on account of his mother's
sickness."</p>

<p>"And you pushed on?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What are you after&mdash;it isn't game, for you've got
no gun."</p>

<p>"No; I'm after a chance to make a living, as much
as anything."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make a living at home?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>"Not one that satisfied me."</p>

<p>"Can you do any better here?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell yet," answered Dean, while an expression
of genuine perplexity overspread his face.
It was a question which he had often asked himself.
"I think if I could come across some mining settlement
I could work for myself or somebody else."</p>

<p>"Are you goin' to stay out all night? There ain't
many hotels round here."</p>

<p>"I have had supper, and am going to spend the
night at a cabin about a mile from here."</p>

<p>"You are!" exclaimed the hunter in a tone of profound
astonishment. "How did you get in?"</p>

<p>"I asked a woman who lives there if she would
let me stop over night, and she was kind enough to
say yes."</p>

<p>"Then you have had your supper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And are you goin' to sleep in the cabin?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you live anywhere near it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should smile! Youngster, that's where I
live, and the woman who gave you your supper is
my mother."</p>

<p>"Then you are Dan," said Dean, eagerly.</p>

<p>"How do you know my name?"</p>

<p>"Your mother told me you killed the bear whose
meat I ate for supper."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>"That's correct, youngster. I killed him, but it's
nothing to kill a b'ar. I've killed hundreds of 'em."</p>

<p>"I should be proud if I could say I had killed
one," said Dean, his eyes sparkling with excitement.</p>

<p>"If you stay round here long enough, you may
have a chance. But I'm goin' home. It's growin'
dark and you may as well go with me."</p>

<p>Dean rose from his recumbent position, and drew
his watch from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it's past eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Let me look at that watch. Is it gold?" asked
his companion, and his eyes showed the same covetous
gleam which Dean had noticed in the mother.</p>

<p>"I wish I had hidden the watch in an inside
pocket," he thought, too late. "I am afraid it will
be taken from me before I get away from these
mountains."</p>

<p>"What might it be worth?" demanded the other,
after fingering it curiously with his clumsy hands.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Dean, guardedly. "I
did not buy it. It was given to me."</p>

<p>"Is it worth a hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is. It may be worth fifty."</p>

<p>"Humph! are you rich?"</p>

<p>"No; far from it! I am a poor boy."</p>

<p>"That doesn't look like it."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>"The watch was given to me by a rich man to
whom I had done a service."</p>

<p>The man handed it back, but it seemed with
reluctance.</p>

<p>"Youngster, what do you think of my mother?"
he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>"She treated me kindly," answered Dean, rather
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Did you agree to pay her for your lodging?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so. Mother ain't one of the soft kind.
Did she strike you as an agreeable old lady?"</p>

<p>"I only saw her for a few minutes," said Dean,
evasively.</p>

<p>His companion laughed, and surveyed Dean quizzically.</p>

<p>"You must stretch your legs, youngster, or
mother'll get tired waiting for me. She might take a
notion not to give me any supper."</p>

<p>It was not long before they came in sight of the
cabin. Here a surprise, and by no means an agreeable
one, awaited Dean. On a bench in front of the
cabin sat a man whom he had good reason to remember,
and equal reason to fear&mdash;Peter Kirby.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="small">"SHOULD OLD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT?"</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If Dean was surprised to see his old enemy in
such an out of the way place, Kirby was no less surprised
to see his former traveling companion. There
was this difference: the encounter brought him
pleasure, while to Dean it carried dismay. Neither
could understand where on earth the other had
sprung from.</p>

<p>"Oho!" laughed Kirby, "so we meet again."</p>

<p>Dan looked surprised, thinking the words were addressed
to him, but following the direction of Kirby's
eyes, he saw that he was mistaken.</p>

<p>"Do you know this boy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Do I know him? Why, we started from the
East together."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"It was at the request of a friend of ours."</p>

<p>"The captain?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And why did you separate?"</p>

<p>"Well, I mustn't tell tales out of school. I am
very glad to meet you again, youngster. Is the
pleasure mutual?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," said Dean, bluntly.</p>

<p>"So I should judge, after the trick you played
upon me at our last meeting."</p>

<p>"What do you refer to?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough. You cautioned Dr.
Thorp against me. Don't deny it, for I know it is
true."</p>

<p>"I don't deny it. What happened that night
showed that I had good reason."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may," said Kirby with an ugly
scowl, "you did a bad thing for yourself. You probably
thought you would never meet me again."</p>

<p>Dean was silent, but Dan, whose curiosity was
aroused, interposed with an inquiry.</p>

<p>"What are you two talkin' about," he said. "Is
this boy a friend or an enemy?"</p>

<p>"He is an enemy of our association," replied
Kirby. "I am glad to have him in my power."</p>

<p>"So there is an association?" thought Dean.
"These two men belong to it, and Squire Bates is
the captain. I shall soon know all about it."</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile the evident hostility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Kirby, reflected in the face of his new acquaintance
Dan, was ominous of danger. Dean felt that he
would gladly pass the night out in the woods exposed
to the night air if he could only get away.
But he saw clearly that escape was not at present
practicable.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the old woman?" asked Dan,
meaning his mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, she told me that she had taken in a kid for
the night, but I had no idea it was any one I knew.
The old lady wears well, Dan."</p>

<p>"Yes, she's tough," said the affectionate son carelessly.
"I'll go in and see whether she's got supper
ready."</p>

<p>He entered the house, leaving Dean and his old
employer together.</p>

<p>"Come here, boy, and sit down," said Kirby smiling,
and eying Dean very much as a cat eyes the
mouse whom she proposes soon to devour. "You
must be tired."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Dean calmly, as he went forward
and seated himself on the settee beside Peter
Kirby.</p>

<p>"What brought you so far West as Colorado?"
proceeded Kirby, giving vent to his curiosity.</p>

<p>"I kept coming West. Besides I heard there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
mines in Colorado, and I thought I might find profitable
work."</p>

<p>"So you gave up playing on that harmonica of
yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make it pay?"</p>

<p>"I needed a partner like the one I started with&mdash;Mr.
Montgomery. I couldn't give an entertainment
alone."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't been making any money
lately?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that watch?"</p>

<p>"From Dr. Thorp."</p>

<p>"When did he give it to you?"</p>

<p>"Just before I left town."</p>

<p>"It was a present to you for informing on me, I
suppose?" said Kirby, his face again assuming an
ugly frown.</p>

<p>"I believe it was for saving him from being
robbed."</p>

<p>"Then he had considerable money and bonds in
the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Were they in the cabinet?"</p>

<p>"He removed them."</p>

<p>"After I went to bed?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"It seems then that I am indebted to you for foiling
my little scheme."</p>

<p>Kirby looked dangerous, and Dean was alive to
the peril incurred, but he was obliged in the interests
of truth to answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Here Dan appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in, Kirby," he said. "Supper's ready."</p>

<p>"I am ready for it. I am about famished. Come
in, boy."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I have supped already."</p>

<p>"All the same you must come in, for I don't propose
to lose sight of you. Hand over that watch,
please."</p>

<p>"Why do you want it?" asked Dean apprehensively.</p>

<p>"I have more claim to it than you. It was the
price of treachery."</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Kirby, you will let me keep it."</p>

<p>"Hand it over without any more words!" said
Kirby, roughly, "unless you want me to take it from
you."</p>

<p>It would have been idle to resist, but Dean was not
willing to hand it over, since that would have indicated
his consent to the surrender.</p>

<p>"You can take it if you choose," he said.</p>

<p>"It will do after supper. Come in!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>Dean preceded Kirby into the cabin, and sat down
on a stool while the two men were eating. Gradually
they dropped into conversation, and Dean listened
with curious interest.</p>

<p>"So you saw the captain, Kirby?" asked Dan.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"He lives in an obscure country place, buried alive,
as I call it. It is for the sake of his family, he says."</p>

<p>"What family has he?"</p>

<p>"A wife and son&mdash;the last as like his father as two
peas&mdash;the same ugly tusks, and long, oval face. Between
the two I prefer the captain. The boy puts on
no end of airs."</p>

<p>"Does he know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a word. He thinks his father a gentleman
of wealth and high birth, and holds his head high, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>"Does that boy know him?" asked Dan, with a
jerk of the head towards Dean.</p>

<p>"You know Brandon Bates, don't you, Dean?" said
Kirby.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you like him?"</p>

<p>"I don't think any one in the village likes him."</p>

<p>"How about his father? is he popular?"</p>

<p>"He is better liked than his son."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>"The fact is," resumed Kirby, "the captain's boy is
an impudent cub. He was insolent to me. I could
have tweaked his nose with pleasure."</p>

<p>"There seems to be one point on which Mr. Kirby
and I agree," thought Dean. But upon the whole it
did not seem to him that he liked Kirby any better
than Brandon Bates. Brandon had unpleasant manners,
but it was clear that Kirby was a professional
thief.</p>

<p>"When is the captain coming West?" asked Dan.</p>

<p>"Soon, I think. He may be needed for some
work in Denver. I shall make a report to him when
I have gathered the information we need, and urge
him to come. He has brains, the captain has, and
he must give us the advantage of them."</p>

<p>"What plan are you thinkin' of Kirby?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Kirby, glancing toward Dean. "I
will speak with you about that later."</p>

<p>After supper they went out again, and sat on the
settee, both smoking pipes provided by Dan. Dean
was invited to come out also, but he felt very much
fatigued, and asked if he might go to bed.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Dan, "can the kid go up to bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if he wants to."</p>

<p>"I'll go up with him."</p>

<p>Dan led the way up a narrow staircase to the second
floor. There were two rooms, each with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
sloping roof. On the floor was spread a sacking
filled with hay, one end raised above the general
level.</p>

<p>"You can sleep there, youngster," said Dan.
"There's no use in undressin'. Lay down as you
are."</p>

<p>Dean was quite ready to do so. Though he was
apprehensive about the future, fatigue asserted its
claim, and in less than five minutes he was sound
asleep.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="small">DEAN FINDS HIMSELF IN A HOLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dean seemed to himself to have slept not more
than an hour, though in reality several hours passed,
when he was aroused by being shaken not over
gently.</p>

<p>"Time to get up?" he asked drowsily.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's time to get up," answered a rough voice.</p>

<p>Now he opened his eyes wide, and he saw Kirby
looking down on him. At a flash all came back to
him, and he realized his position.</p>

<p>He rose from his pallet and asked, "Can I wash
my face and hands?"</p>

<p>"No; there is no time for it. Follow me!"</p>

<p>Rightly concluding that it would be useless to
question Kirby, Dean followed him to the lower
floor, where Dan had already seated himself at the
breakfast-table. In obedience to a signal Dean sat
down also, and ate with what appetite he could the
repast spread before him. In addition to cold meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
and bread there was what passed for coffee, though
it probably was not even distantly related to the
fragrant beverage which we know by that name.
Dean drank it, however, not without relish, for it was
at least hot.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes sufficed for breakfast, and then
Dan and Kirby left the cabin, motioning to Dean to
follow.</p>

<p>Outside the cabin Kirby said, "Have you a handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dean, wondering why such a
question should be asked.</p>

<p>"Give it to me!"</p>

<p>Dean mechanically obeyed.</p>

<p>Kirby took it, and, folding it, tied it over Dean's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Are we going to play blind man's buff?" asked
Dean.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Kirby grimly, "and you are the
blind man."</p>

<p>"I should like to know what you have done this
for," said Dean, more seriously.</p>

<p>"I can't answer your question, but no harm will
come to you if you keep quiet. You are going to
take a walk with us."</p>

<p>"And you don't want me to know where you are
taking me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>"You've hit it right the first time, youngster," said
Dan.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's no use to resist," said Dean firmly,
"but I must say that you have no right to take away
my freedom."</p>

<p>"You can say it if you want to, but it won't make
any difference."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"You'll know in time."</p>

<p>Dan and Kirby ranged themselves one on each
side of Dean, and he was walked off between them.
He asked one or two questions, but was admonished
to keep silence. So they walked for twenty minutes,
or perhaps half an hour, when Dan left his side, and
Dean was compelled to halt in the custody of Kirby.</p>

<p>"It's all ready!" said Dan, reappearing. Again
he took Dean by the arm, and they walked forward
perhaps a dozen paces.</p>

<p>Then Kirby said, "Here are some steps."</p>

<p>Dean found himself descending a flight of steps&mdash;ten
in number, for he took the trouble to count them.
He was getting more and more mystified, and would
have given a good deal to remove the handkerchief
that bandaged his eyes, but it was impossible to do
it even surreptitiously, for both arms were pinioned
by his guides. At the end of the flight of steps they
came again to level ground, and walked forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
perhaps a hundred feet. Dean suspected from the
earthy odor that they were under the ground. He
soon learned that his supposition was correct, for his
guides halted, and loosened their hold upon his
arms.</p>

<p>"You can remove the handkerchief now," said
Kirby.</p>

<p>Dean lost no time in availing himself of this
permission.</p>

<p>He looked around him eagerly.</p>

<p>He found himself in what appeared to be not a
natural, but an artificial cave&mdash;dark, save for the
light of a kerosene lamp, which was placed on a
little rocky shelf, and diffused a sickly light about
the cellar. At the end of the room there was a passage
leading, as it seemed, to some inner apartment.</p>

<p>Dean looked about in surprise.</p>

<p>"What place is this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You may call it a cave if you like."</p>

<p>"How long are you going to stay here?"</p>

<p>"About five minutes."</p>

<p>"That will be enough for me," said Dean shrugging
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Hardly. You are to stay longer."</p>

<p>"Are you going to leave me here&mdash;under the
earth?" asked Dean, in alarm.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you be scared, youngster&mdash;you will be
safe. You won't be alone. Here, Pompey."</p>

<p>Through the inner passage came a stunted negro,
with a preternaturally large head, around which was
pinned a cotton cloth in the shape of a turban. He
bowed obsequiously, and eyed Dean with evident
curiosity mingled with surprise.</p>

<p>"This boy has come to visit you, Pompey," said
Kirby, with grim pleasantry.</p>

<p>"Yah, yah, massa!" chuckled Pompey, showing
the whites of his eyes.</p>

<p>"You must take good care of him. Give him
something to eat when he is hungry, but don't let
him escape."</p>

<p>"Yah, massa!"</p>

<p>"He will ask you questions, but you must be careful
what you tell him. Remember, he is not one of
us, and he mustn't learn too much."</p>

<p>"Yah, massa! I understand. What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Dean."</p>

<p>"Dat's a funny name. I never heard the like."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have. Dan's like it."</p>

<p>"So it am, massa! Dat's a fac'."</p>

<p>"Now, youngster, I am going to leave you in the
company of Pompey here, who will do his best to
make you comfortable and happy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"When are you coming back for me?" asked Dean,
apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Well, that depends upon circumstances. You'd
better not trouble yourself about that. Perhaps in a
week, perhaps in a month. In the meantime you
will have free board, and won't have to work for a
living. There are a good many who would like to
change places with you."</p>

<p>"If you meet any such, send them along," said
Dean, with a jocoseness that thinly veiled a feeling
bordering upon despair.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! That's a good one. Dan, our young
friend is becoming a practical joker. That's right,
young one. Keep up good courage. I must bid you
good-bye now. Come along, Dan."</p>

<p>The two turned away, and Dean with despairing
eyes saw them going back to freedom and the light
of day, while he was left in the company of an
ignorant black in a subterranean dungeon.</p>

<p>"Law, honey, don't take on!" said Pompey,
good-naturedly. "There ain't no harm comin' to
you."</p>

<p>"I should think harm had come to me. Here am
I shut up in this black hole!"</p>

<p>"'Taint so bad, honey, when you're used to it. I
didn't like it first myself."</p>

<p>"How long have you lived down here?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't justly say."</p>

<p>"Is it a year, or a month?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, young massa," answered Pompey,
who was evidently bent on carrying out Kirby's admonitions
not to tell too much to his young guest.</p>

<p>"When did you come hyah?" asked Pompey,
thinking it only fair that he should ask a question.</p>

<p>"Into this neighborhood? I only came yesterday."</p>

<p>"And where did you meet Massa Kirby?"</p>

<p>"At the cabin of the other man&mdash;Dan. But I had
seen him before. I met him first at the East, in New
York State."</p>

<p>"In York State!" repeated Pompey.</p>

<p>"Yes. We traveled together for a while."</p>

<p>Pompey nodded his head slowly, but evidently he
had no very clear idea of what it all meant.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry, young massa?" he asked, after
a pause.</p>

<p>"No; I have had my breakfast."</p>

<p>"I must go to work," said the negro, turning to go
back by the narrow passage from which he had
emerged.</p>

<p>"May I go with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, young massa, if you want to."</p>

<p>Anything was better than being left alone in the
dark, cavernous room, and Dean followed the negro,
who was so short that he could readily look over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
head, till at the end of the passage he emerged into
another apartment, which was fitted up as a kitchen,
and contained a stove. From the stove rose an upright
funnel, which pierced the roof, providing a vent
for the smoke when there was a fire, and allowing
air to come in from above. It flashed upon Dean
that it was through this funnel had come the mysterious
sounds which puzzled him so much when he
was reclining in the wood.</p>




<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="small">THE VALUE OF A HARMONICA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>About the middle of the forenoon Pompey curled
up on a pallet in one corner of the room, and went
to sleep. There was nothing in particular to do, and
it seemed rather a sensible way of spending the
time. Dean, however, felt too anxious to follow his
example.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that it would be a good time
for him to gratify his curiosity by examining the
cavern in which he was immured, and devise, if possible,
some method of escape. First he went up
close to Pompey, and examined him carefully to see
whether he was really asleep, or only shamming.
But the negro's deep breathing soon satisfied him that
there was no sham about his slumber. So Dean felt
at liberty to begin his exploration.</p>

<p>He went back to the entrance, which he knew by
the staircase he had descended with Kirby and Dan.
He mounted to the top, and found his way barred by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
a trap-door which he tried, but unsuccessfully, to
raise. It appeared to be secured by a lock, and, not
having the key, there was no hope of escape. He
gazed ruefully at this door, which shut him out from
liberty.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is any other way out of the
cave," he asked himself.</p>

<p>It didn't seem probable, but it was of course possible,
and worth while to investigate. If there were
it would be at the other end, no doubt.</p>

<p>He retraced his steps, and found Pompey still fast
asleep, and utterly unconscious of the movements of
the prisoner under his charge.</p>

<p>Dean took a lamp and went farther into the cave.
There seemed to be a series of excavations, connected
by narrow passages. In one of these was a
large box, constructed like a sailor's chest. It occurred
to him that it might belong to Pompey, and
be used by him to contain his clothing. But a little
thought suggested that the negro was not likely to
have a large stock of clothes. Probably the suit he
had on was about all he possessed. What, then, did
the chest contain?</p>

<p>At each end was a handle. Dean took hold of one
and tried to lift the chest. But he found it very heavy,
much heavier than it would have been had it contained
clothing.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>He rose to his feet and eyed it with curiosity.
There was nothing elaborate about the lock, and it
struck Dean that a key which he had in his pocket
might possibly unlock it. Upon the impulse of the
moment he kneeled down and inserted it in the lock.</p>

<p>Very much to his surprise, and indeed it did seem
an extraordinary chance, for it was the only key he
had, it proved to fit the lock. He turned it, and
raised the lid. The sight dazzled him.</p>

<p>Before him lay piles of gold and silver coins, and
a package of bank bills. This cave was evidently
the store house of an organized band of robbers, and
the chest might be considered their treasury.</p>

<p>"I wonder if this is real," thought Dean. "It
seems like a scene in the Arabian Nights."</p>

<p>It did indeed seem strange that this far off nook of
Colorado should be the rendezvous and treasure
house of a band so widely scattered that the captain
was a quiet citizen of a small town in the State of
New York, nearly two thousand miles away.</p>

<p>How improbable it would have seemed to the
Citizens of Waterford, among whom Squire Bates
moved, living in outward seeming the life of any
other respectable and law abiding citizen! This was
the Waterford mystery, which by a series of remarkable
adventures it had fallen to Dean to solve.</p>

<p>He locked the chest, fearing that Pompey might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
suddenly awake, and, following, discover what he
was about. He wanted some time to think over
this strange discovery, and consider what to do. To
be sure, there seemed little chance of his doing anything
except to remain where he was, a subterranean
prisoner.</p>

<p>Dean felt more than ever a desire to leave the cave,
but the prospect was not encouraging. Why he was
kept a prisoner he could guess. He knew too much
of the band, and especially of their leader, and he
was considered dangerous. His imprisonment might
be a prolonged one, and Dean felt that this would
be intolerable.</p>

<p>It was in a very sober frame that he returned to
the room where Pompey was still sleeping. An hour
later the negro awoke and stretched himself.</p>

<p>"Have I been asleep long, young massa?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Two or three hours, I should think, Pompey."</p>

<p>"Dat's strange! I only just closed my eyes for a
minute, and I done forgot myself."</p>

<p>"You might as well go to sleep. There's nothing
else to do."</p>

<p>"I must get some dinner, honey. Don't you feel
hungry?"</p>

<p>"I might eat something," said Dean listlessly.</p>

<p>Pompey bustled round, and prepared a lunch, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
which Dean, homesick as he was, did not fail to do
justice. It takes a great deal to spoil the appetite of
a growing boy.</p>

<p>After the noon repast Dean sat down. He was
beginning to find the monotony intolerable.</p>

<p>"Have you got any books down here, Pompey?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Pompey shook his head.</p>

<p>"No use for books, young massa. I can't read."</p>

<p>"But I can."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Massa Kirby will bring you some if you
ask him."</p>

<p>Dean did not care to ask any favor of Kirby.
Moreover he knew that that gentleman was not particularly
literary, and doubted if he was in a position
to grant the request.</p>

<p>By way of beguiling the time he took out his harmonica
in an absent mood, and began to play "Old
Folks at Home."</p>

<p>Instantly Pompey was on the alert. His eyes
brightened, and he fixed them in rapture upon the
young player.</p>

<p>"What's dat, young massa?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's a harmonica."</p>

<p>"You do play beau'ful, young massa."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Pompey, I am glad you like it."</p>

<p>"Play some more," entreated Pompey.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>Dean complied with the negro's request, partly because
he was obliging, partly because it helped to
fill up the time. He could scarcely forbear laughing
to see Pompey rocking to and fro with his mouth
open, drinking in the melodious strains.</p>

<p>Nature had given Pompey a rapt appreciation of
music, and he began to croon a vocal accompaniment
to the instrument.</p>

<p>"Who learn you to play, young massa?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I taught myself. It isn't hard."</p>

<p>"Dat's because your white. A poor nigger like
me couldn't learn," said Pompey half inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you could. I see you have an ear for
music. Would you like to try?"</p>

<p>"If you would let me."</p>

<p>Dean handed the negro the harmonica, and gave
him the necessary directions. In the course of half
an hour he was able to play through "Old Folks at
Home," with substantial accuracy.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a harmonicum," said Pompey wistfully.
"It would make old Pompey happy."</p>

<p>An idea came into Dean's head&mdash;a wild, perhaps an
impracticable idea, but he resolved to carry it out, if
possible.</p>

<p>"Pompey," he said, "I'll give you the harmonica
if you'll let me out of the cave."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>Pompey rolled his eyes in affright.</p>

<p>"Couldn't do it no how, young massa," he said.
"Massa Kirby would kill me."</p>

<p>"He'd think I got away when you were asleep,
Pompey. Come, I'll show you two or three more
tunes on the instrument, and you can learn others
yourself."</p>

<p>"I don't dare to, young massa," said Pompey, but
there was a suspicion of indecision in his voice.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, give me back the harmonica.
I will never play any more upon it."</p>

<p>"Oh, young massa!"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say, Pompey"&mdash;and Dean put
the harmonica in his pocket.</p>

<p>Pompey eyed him with a troubled look. He was
evidently weighing the matter in his mind.</p>

<p>"If I thought Massa Kirby wouldn't kill me," he
said reflectively.</p>

<p>Dean upon this redoubled his persuasions. He
played another tune on the harmonica&mdash;"Sweet
Home"&mdash;with variations, and this completed the
conquest of his sable custodian.</p>

<p>"I'll do it, young massa," said Pompey, hoarsely.
"Give me the harmonicum, and I'll take the risk."</p>

<p>Dean did not want to give him time for reflection.
He seized his hat, and handed Pompey the instrument.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>The negro guided him, not to the front entrance
which he already knew, but to a back exit which he
had overlooked. Here there was a door skillfully concealed
on the outside. Pompey drew out a key,
opened it, and with infinite relief Dean again saw the
sunshine and breathed the air of freedom.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Pompey!" he said. "I thank you
with all my heart."</p>

<p>"If Massa Kirby cotch you, don't you tell him I
let you go," said Pompey, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"No, I won't, Pompey, but I don't mean to let
him catch me."</p>

<p>The door closed behind him, and Dean paused to
consider what course to take. He must at all hazards
avoid falling in with Kirby and Dan.</p>

<p>"That harmonica is worth its weight in gold!"
thought Dean, gratefully. "It is a regular talisman."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="small">TWO NEW ACQUAINTANCES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dean had no particular choice as to the direction
he would take. His principal desire was to get out
of the neighborhood, so as to avoid meeting Kirby
or Dan, as this would insure a second term of imprisonment
from which he could not hope to escape
so easily. He had a general idea of the location of
the cabin in which he had passed the previous night,
and he shaped his course as far away from it as possible.
He looked at his watch, which Kirby had
neglected to take, and found that it was between
four and five in the afternoon. He did not know
how far the wooded district extended, but hoped
soon to emerge from it.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small">MR. KIRBY WAS COUNTING A NUMBER OF $50 BILLS.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>It might have been that he was bewildered, but
the farther he traveled the more he seemed to be
surrounded by trees. Moreover the shades were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
deepening, and soon the night would settle about
him.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a compass," thought Dean. "That
would help me find my way out of this labyrinth."</p>

<p>He had met no one as yet, and this was upon the
whole a relief, as the persons most likely to be encountered
were Kirby and Dan. But at length a
sound of voices fell upon his ear, and he stayed his
steps in momentary alarm. He listened intently,
but was reassured when he found that the voices
were unfamiliar.</p>

<p>"It may be some one who can show me the way
out of these woods," thought Dean. "At any rate
I don't believe they will harm a boy. I will try to
find them."</p>

<p>Guided by the voices he directed his steps in the
direction of the sound, and found himself at length
in an open space. Under a tree reclined two stalwart
men who, from their garb, appeared to be
miners. They were lying in an easy position, and
both were smoking pipes.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, gentlemen," said Dean politely.</p>

<p>The two men looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a kid!" ejaculated one. "How came
you here, boy?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, if you don't mind my joining you,"
said Dean.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>"Come and welcome! It's rather refreshing to
see a young chap like you. I've got a boy at home
who is within a year or two as old as you."</p>

<p>"I am sixteen."</p>

<p>"So I thought. My boy is fourteen. What is
your name?"</p>

<p>"Dean Dunham. I come from Waterford, New
York."</p>

<p>"Then you are from my State. I am from Syracuse.
My name is Rawson&mdash;Ben Rawson. My
friend here is Ebenezer Jones, commonly called
Eben, a Connecticut Yankee&mdash;Eben, shake with our
young friend."</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you, Mr. Jones," said Dean,
extending his hand with a smile.</p>

<p>"You must look out for Eben," said Rawson
jocosely. "Them Connecticut Yankees are as sharp
as they make 'em."</p>

<p>"I will risk it," said Dean. "I am very glad to
meet you both, for I was beginning to feel that I
was lost."</p>

<p>"Eben and I are too good mountaineers to be
easily lost. How long have you been in these
woods?"</p>

<p>"Since yesterday noon."</p>

<p>"Did you sleep out?"</p>

<p>"No, I found a cabin where I lodged."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>"You were in luck."</p>

<p>"In bad luck."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Rawson in surprise. "Were
you robbed?"</p>

<p>"No, but I found myself in the company of two
men who I am pretty sure belong to a gang of robbers.
One of them I had seen before&mdash;at the East.
They blindfolded me, and took me, to a cavern,
where they left me in charge of a negro named
Pompey."</p>

<p>"What could be their object?" asked Rawson.
"You are sure you're not romancing, boy?"</p>

<p>"I wish I were, but the cave exists, just as certainly
as I do."</p>

<p>"But of what use is it?"</p>

<p>"I think it is a hiding-place for their booty," answered
Dean, and he gave an account of the chest
which he had opened, and the nature of its contents.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you take a handful of the gold?"
asked Rawson.</p>

<p>"At the time I didn't know but I should have to
remain in the cave, when of course it would be discovered
on me. Besides, though I knew it to be
stolen property I didn't feel like taking it."</p>

<p>"Eben and I wouldn't be so particular. Whereabouts
is this cave?"</p>

<p>"I think it must be three or four miles away, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
I may be mistaken, for I got turned round, and may
have doubled on my tracks. I have been afraid I
might fall in with Kirby and Dan. When I heard
your voices I thought at first it might be them."</p>

<p>"You're safe now, lad. We would be more than
a match for them, even if they did turn up. I
shouldn't mind giving them a lesson. But you
haven't told us what brought you out here, lad."</p>

<p>"I thought I might make a better living than at
home."</p>

<p>"And have you?"</p>

<p>"So far I have, but my prospects don't appear to
be very bright just now."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that. Suppose you join us."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to do so, if you will let me."</p>

<p>"Then we'll shake hands to our better acquaintance.
I'd offer you a pipe if I had an extra one."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I don't smoke."</p>

<p>"Well, lad, perhaps you're right. Smoking won't
do any good to a boy like you."</p>

<p>"If I am to join you would you mind telling me
your plans?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will. We're miners, as you might
guess from our looks. We've been up in Gilpin
County, and have done pretty well. We've got some
claims there yet, but we wanted a little change and
have been on a little prospecting tour."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you had good luck?"</p>

<p>"In prospecting? No! We are on our way
back, and shall settle down to work again all the
better for our holiday."</p>

<p>"How long have you been out here?" asked
Dean.</p>

<p>"I've been here fourteen months&mdash;Eben for a
year. We never met before, but we concluded to
join forces, and haven't regretted it, eh&mdash;Eben?"</p>

<p>"Right you are, Rawson."</p>

<p>"Eben here has a girl at home that's waiting for
him. When he has made his pile, he's going back
to her."</p>

<p>"And how about you, Mr. Rawson?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about the handle to my name,
youngster. Call me Ben."</p>

<p>"But you are so much older than I," objected
Dean.</p>

<p>"We're free and easy out here&mdash;it's the best way.
When we get back to the East you may call me Mr.
Rawson if you want to. I say, Eben, if we take the
boy into partnership, he ought to have some capital."</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I can't put in any capital," said
Dean. "Besides this watch I haven't over five
dollars about me."</p>

<p>"You misunderstand me, lad. I mean that Eben
and I should set you up in business. We've got six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
claims&mdash;between us. What do you say, Eben, to
giving this boy two? Then we shall be equal partners,
and share and share alike."</p>

<p>"It's just as you say, Ben," answered Eben, who
was evidently guided in all things by his older companion.</p>

<p>"You are very generous, Ben," said Dean, "but
I ought not to accept such a gift. If you don't mind
giving me one, I will take it, and thank you."</p>

<p>"No, lad," persisted Rawson. "It's share and
share alike, as I said."</p>

<p>"But I ought not to be on equal terms with you
two, who have others to look out for."</p>

<p>"You won't be, lad&mdash;Eben and I have each got a
pile salted down in one of the banks in Denver. It's
near five thousand dollars apiece, isn't it, Eben?"</p>

<p>"Yes, not far from that, Rawson."</p>

<p>"We will share alike for the future&mdash;that's what I
mean. There's more gold where the other came
from, and I hope the claims will pan out well for
your sake."</p>

<p>Dean felt that he had indeed fallen into good
hands. He might have traveled far enough in the
East without meeting strangers so free-handed. Indeed
had he met the same parties at home, he would
scarcely have found them so liberal. The wild, free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
life of the West had opened their hearts and made
them generous.</p>

<p>"Hist!" said Rawson suddenly, raising his hand,
and assuming an intent look, "I think I hear
voices."</p>

<p>He was right. Two men, walking slowly, and
appearing to be in earnest conversation, approached.
"It's Dan and Kirby!" said Dean in
excitement.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="small">OUT OF THE ENEMY'S HANDS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"Eben and I will hide and leave you to receive
them alone," said Rawson, rising hastily.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" expostulated Dean in considerable
alarm.</p>

<p>"Don't be afeared, lad. They shan't do you any
harm. We want a little fun, that's all. We shall
be close at hand."</p>

<p>The two darted behind a tree, leaving Dean reclining
on the turf.</p>

<p>Kirby and Dan approached, engaged apparently
in earnest conversation. They were close upon
Dean before they recognized him. It is needless to
say that their amazement was profound.</p>

<p>"Look there, Dan!" said Kirby, stopping short.</p>

<p>"There's the kid!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm beat!" ejaculated Dan.</p>

<p>"How on earth can he have escaped? If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
got away without Pompey's knowledge he's about
the smartest youngster I ever came across. I
will take care it shan't happen again."</p>

<p>Striding forward, Kirby confronted Dean with a
stern face.</p>

<p>Dean, by way of carrying out the deception,
started and assumed a look of terror.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean, boy?" demanded Kirby.</p>

<p>"What does what mean?" asked Dean in apparent
perplexity.</p>

<p>"How came you here? You know well enough
what I mean."</p>

<p>"I walked," answered Dean demurely.</p>

<p>"Of course you did! How did you get out of the
place where I put you?"</p>

<p>"I went out at the back door."</p>

<p>Kirby turned to Dan in alarm.</p>

<p>"Was it unlocked?" he asked, resuming his examination
of the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes; if it hadn't been I couldn't have got out."</p>

<p>"Where is Pompey&mdash;the negro? What did you
do to him?" asked Kirby suspiciously.</p>

<p>"He fell asleep after dinner."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you took the key from him in his
sleep," said Kirby, rather as a statement than an
inquiry.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>Dean made no reply, and Peter Kirby took this as
an admission that he was right.</p>

<p>"That must be the way, Dan," he said, turning to
his companion. "It's lucky we met our young
friend here, or we might have been deprived of his
society."</p>

<p>Dean looked depressed, and Kirby was deceived
by his manner.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know what's going to happen?"
he said, addressing himself to Dean.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll soon know. You're going back to
keep company with Pompey. He is very lonesome
there in the cave, and he will be brightened up by
having a boy as company."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Kirby, please let me go on my way!"
pleaded Dean.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disappoint you, but it can't be
done. Sit down, Dan. We've got a long walk
before us, and we will rest a while."</p>

<p>The two men seated themselves one on each side
of Dean, occupying the exact places recently vacated
by the two miners. Kirby had been angry at first with
Dean, but the exultation he felt at recovering him
abated his wrath and made him good-natured. He
felt like the cat who has the mouse securely in his
power.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>"Oho!" he laughed, "this is a good joke! This
foolish lad really supposed that he had bidden us
good-by. Didn't you, lad?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I never expected to see you again."</p>

<p>Kirby laughed again.</p>

<p>"My lad," he said, "you are not yet smart enough
to circumvent Peter Kirby. You'll have to be several
years older at least."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kirby," said Dean, earnestly, "will you tell
me why you want to keep me a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I say that I like your society?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't believe you."</p>

<p>"You are a sharp one, youngster. That isn't the
only reason."</p>

<p>"So I thought. What is the reason, then?"</p>

<p>"You know too much and suspect too much, boy.
You're a pesky young spy. We don't propose to
leave you at liberty to injure us."</p>

<p>"Was that why Squire Bates arranged for you to
take me with you?" asked Dean, with a penetrating
look.</p>

<p>"What motive could he have except to help you to
a position?" answered Kirby, evasively.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Dean, emphasizing the
last word.</p>

<p>"But you suspect something. Is that it?"</p>

<p>Dean nodded.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>"Boy, you are too candid for your own good. It
is clear that you are too sharp to be kept at liberty."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to take me back to the cave?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why not let me travel with you instead? I should
prefer it to such a gloomy prison."</p>

<p>"No doubt you would, but, as it happens, I am
not bound to respect or consult your wishes. No
doubt you think you would have a better chance to
escape if I let you go with me."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dean demurely.</p>

<p>"So I thought, and that is the very reason I can't
gratify you. I can't be bothered with a boy I must
constantly watch, though, for that matter, if you
played me false again," he added sternly, "I
shouldn't scruple to put a bullet through your head."</p>

<p>He looked fiercely at Dean as if he meant it.
Dean had no doubt that nothing but a fear of the
consequences would deter him from the desperate
act he hinted at, and he rejoiced more than ever that
he had two stalwart friends so near at hand.</p>

<p>There was a little more conversation between
Kirby and Dan, and then Kirby rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Well, boy," he said abruptly, "it is time for us
to be going."</p>

<p>"Go if you like, Mr. Kirby!" said Dean quietly.
"I prefer to remain where I am."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>"What, boy?" exclaimed Kirby angrily, "do you
mean to defy us?"</p>

<p>"I mean, Mr. Kirby, that you have no right to
interfere with me, or to deprive me of my freedom."</p>

<p>"No right, have I?" inquired Kirby in a sarcastic
tone.</p>

<p>"That is what I said."</p>

<p>"Then, boy, you'd better not have said it. You
won't fare any better for it, I can tell you that. Come,
get up, and at once!"</p>

<p>He leaned over, and grasping Dean by the collar
pulled him roughly to his feet.</p>

<p>The next moment, he thought he had been struck
by lightning. He received a blow on the side of his
head that stretched him full length on the ground.</p>

<p>When he rose, vaguely wondering what had happened,
he confronted not the boy he had assaulted,
but a strong, athletic man, with a powerful frame,
and a stern, resolute eye.</p>

<p>This was Rawson, but he was not alone. Standing
between Dean and Dan was another man,
younger, but looking quite as powerful, Eben Jones,
of Connecticut.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by this outrage?" demanded
Kirby, with a baffled look, gnawing his nether lip in
abortive wrath.</p>

<p>"That's a question for me to ask, stranger," retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Rawson coolly. "What do you mean by
assaulting this boy?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean? He is my servant, who has
deserted and deceived me."</p>

<p>"Is this true, lad?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. I came West with this man, as a
secretary, not knowing his character. I found out
that he was a thief and then I left him."</p>

<p>"You shall answer for this, boy!" said Kirby, almost
frothing at the mouth. "How dare you insult
me?"</p>

<p>"The boy is telling the truth. I make no doubt,
if you call that insulting you," said Rawson. "He
tells us you shut him up in a cave."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'll do it again."</p>

<p>"Will you indeed? You are at liberty to try."</p>

<p>"What have you got to do with the boy, any
way?"</p>

<p>"A good deal. We have just admitted him as a
partner in our mining firm. You'll find us in Gilpin
County if you want to call, though on the whole I
wouldn't advise it, as we miners make short shrift of
such fellows as you are."</p>

<p>"The boy must come with us!" said Kirby, doggedly,
unwilling to own himself beaten.</p>

<p>"I've got something to say to that, stranger, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
it's quickly said. Make yourselves scarce both of
you, or you'll never know what hit you."</p>

<p>He pulled from his girdle a six shooter, and
pointed it at Kirby.</p>

<p>The latter needed no second hint. He and Dan
turned and walked away, muttering some ugly
threats to which the two miners paid no heed.</p>

<p>"Now, lad, we'll have some supper," said Rawson,
"and look out for a good place to pass the
night. I can't say much for your friends. They're
about as ugly-looking knaves as I ever saw."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Dean, heartily. "I hope
I shall never see them again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="small">SIX MONTHS AMONG THE MINES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Six months later among the hills in Gilpin County
we find three old acquaintances. They are Ben
Rawson, Ebenezer Jones, and Dean Dunham. Dean
has grown taller and there is a healthy brown hue on
his cheeks. His eyes are bright, and his look is
cheerful.</p>

<p>The three are sitting in front of a miner's cabin,
resting after the fatigues of the day.</p>

<p>"Have a pipe, Dean?" asks Rawson.</p>

<p>"No, Ben; you know I don't smoke."</p>

<p>"You're right, lad, no doubt, but I couldn't get
along without it. Do you know, boys, it is just six
months to-day since we came here, after our brief
interview with Dean's friends. By the way, what are
their names?"</p>

<p>"Peter Kirby and Dan&mdash;I don't know his last
name."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder what has become of them. It is easy
to tell what will befall them at last."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall never set eyes on them again,"
said Dean, fervently.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't just say that; I might like to meet
them if they were about to receive their deserts."</p>

<p>"Do you know how we stand, Rawson?" asked
Eben Jones, taking the pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>"I was just figuring up, Eben, this afternoon,
since you have made me treasurer. There's a little
over three thousand dollars in the common fund."</p>

<p>"A thousand dollars apiece."</p>

<p>"Precisely. It isn't a bad showing, is it? What
do you say to that, Dean? How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen, but I am nearer seventeen."</p>

<p>"There are not many boys of your age who are
worth a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"I owe it to your kindness, Ben&mdash;yours and
Eben's."</p>

<p>"I don't admit that, Dean. You have worked
hard for it."</p>

<p>"But then I am only a boy, and yet you admit
me to an equal partnership."</p>

<p>"And we're glad to do it, Dean," said Rawson,
warmly. "Isn't that so, Eben?"</p>

<p>"You're talkin' for us both, Ben. The kid's been
a great deal of company for us."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>"Besides, Dean, Eben and I have got ten thousand
dollars between us in a bank in Denver, unless
the bank's busted, which I haven't heard of. I say,
Eben, old chap, I feel rich!"</p>

<p>"I feel rich enough to go home," said Eben, after
a thoughtful pause. "Would you mind if I did,
Ben?"</p>

<p>"I should mind so much, Eben, that I should
probably go along too."</p>

<p>"But that would be leaving Dean alone," objected
Eben.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he would like to make a trip East also."</p>

<p>"Yes, I would," said Dean. "It's a long time since
I've heard from my uncle and aunt. I think my last
letter couldn't have reached them."</p>

<p>"There's one thing in the way," observed Rawson.
"Our claims are valuable&mdash;more so than six months
ago. If we leave 'em some one will take possession,
and that'll be an end of our ownership."</p>

<p>"Sell 'em," said Eben, concisely.</p>

<p>"That will take time."</p>

<p>"I'll stay till it's done. I'm not going to give 'em
away."</p>

<p>"Trust a Connecticut Yankee for that," said Rawson,
laughing. "Well, to-morrow, then, we'll let
our neighbors know that our claims are for sale."</p>

<p>Dean and his two friends retired at an early hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
They usually became fatigued by the labors of the
day, and did not require to court slumber long.
They rose early, and took their breakfast at a restaurant
near by. Before this was opened, they took
turns at cooking breakfast themselves, but were glad
to delegate that duty to some one else.</p>

<p>Dean, as the best penman, prepared the sign,</p>


<p class="center in0 p2t p2b">THESE CLAIMS FOR SALE.</p>


<p class="in0">rather fortunately, as Rawson was weak not only in
writing but in spelling, and would have been very
likely to write "Theas clames fer sail," without a
thought that he had committed an error.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock on the second morning, a small
man, dressed in a drab suit, walked leisurely up to
Rawson, and remarked: "I understand that you
wish to sell these claims."</p>

<p>"Exactly, if we can get a fair price."</p>

<p>"By we you mean&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Myself, Mr. Jones, and the boy. We are partners.
Where might you be from, friend?"</p>

<p>"I have an office in Denver. I am commissioned
by a Philadelphia syndicate to buy some mining
property, which will be worked with the help of improved
machinery in a systematic manner."</p>

<p>"Then you will need more than we have to sell."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>"I have secured the property on each side of you,"
said the agent composedly.</p>

<p>"What figures are you prepared to offer?" asked
Rawson, with a look of business. "I don't want
to be extortionate, but the claims are good ones, and
we don't want to sacrifice them."</p>

<p>Then ensued a few minutes of bargaining, in
which Dean took no part. Eben, though usually
the most silent of the three, now developed the qualities
characteristic of the New England Yankee, and
it was due to him that the property was sold for six
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"I might have got more if I'd stood out a little
longer," he said, half regretfully.</p>

<p>"We've done pretty well, though," said Rawson,
complacently. "It's two thousand dollars apiece,
say three, with what we've taken from it in the last
six months. What do you say to that, lad? You'll
go home with three thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible, Ben. Why, Uncle
Adin has been at work for forty years, and I don't
believe the old place would fetch that."</p>

<p>"Money's easier to come at than in the old times.
You'll astonish the old folks, lad."</p>

<p>"There'll be some others that'll be surprised,"
said Dean, smiling. "Squire Bates and Brandon
among the rest."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>"It's better than going home like a tramp. It's
strange how much more people think of you when
you're worth a little property. And I don't know but
they're right. To get money, I mean honestly, a man
must have some brains, and he must be willing to
work. How much money do you think I had when
I arrived here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Eighteen dollars. It was grit or brains with me,
I can tell you. Eben here wasn't much better off."</p>

<p>"Not so well. I only had nine dollars."</p>

<p>"And now we've got eight thousand apiece.
That'll make us comfortable for a while, eh, Eben?"</p>

<p>"For life, Rawson. I shall never come back here,
but settle down at home, where people will call me
a rich man."</p>

<p>"I can't answer for myself. How is it with you,
Dean?"</p>

<p>"I shall come back," said Dean, positively.
"There's very little chance for me in Waterford."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you are right. You'll have a
fair start, and you're industrious and enterprising."</p>

<p>They stopped in Denver on their way home, and
called at the office of the agent through whom their
claims had been sold.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the agent, "may I venture to
give you some advice?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," said Rawson.</p>

<p>"The best thing you can do with a part of your
money is to invest in real estate in this town."</p>

<p>Eben Jones shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm going to buy a farm at home, and put the rest
of the money in the savings bank," he said.</p>

<p>"How is it with you, Mr. Rawson?"</p>

<p>"No doubt your advice is good, but I want to let
the folks at home see what I have brought in solid
cash."</p>

<p>"And you?" continued the agent, turning to
Dean.</p>

<p>"I will invest two thousand dollars in Denver lots,"
said Dean, promptly, "and take the rest home as a
present to my uncle and aunt."</p>

<p>"You won't regret it. Denver is growing rapidly.
I predict that the lots will double in your hands in a
year."</p>

<p>Dean took a walk round the embryo city with the
agent, and made a purchase of ten lots on Lawrence
street, in accordance with his judgment.</p>

<p>"Now," said the agent, smiling, "I shall be sure to
see you out here again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="small">AFFAIRS IN WATERFORD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Leaving Dean in Denver, let us go back to Waterford,
and see how matters stood in that quiet little
village.</p>

<p>With Adin Dunham they did not go well. He had
an attack of rheumatism during the winter which
hindered him from working for several weeks, and
so abridged his earnings. Both he and his wife
missed Dean, whose lively and cheerful temperament
enlivened the house. They were troubled too because
months had passed since they had heard from
him.</p>

<p>"I don't know what has happened to Dean," said
Adin one Saturday evening, when he sat beside the
kitchen fire with his wife. "Seems to me he'd write
if he was in good health. I am afeared something
has gone wrong with the boy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope not, father," said Sarah Dunham, pausing
in her knitting.</p>

<p>"So do I, Sarah, but you must agree that it's
strange he don't write."</p>

<p>"That's true, Adin. He was always a thoughtful,
considerate boy. The house seems lonesome without
him."</p>

<p>"So it does, Sarah. But if I only knew he was
doin' well I wouldn't mind that. He may have got
sick and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say such things, father," said Mrs. Dunham
in a tremulous voice. "I can't bear to think
anything's happened to the boy."</p>

<p>"But we must be prepared for the worst, if so be
the worst has come."</p>

<p>"I am sure he is alive and well," said Sarah Dunham,
who was of a more hopeful temperament than
her husband.</p>

<p>"Then why don't he write?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, Adin. That's something I can't explain.
But Dean's healthy, and he's a good boy,
who wouldn't be likely to get into mischief. Instead
of being prepared for the worst, suppose we hope
for the best."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right, Sarah. I try to be cheerful,
but since I was robbed of that thousand dollars luck
seems to have been against me. And the worst of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
is Sarah, I'm not getting younger. I shall be sixty-five
next month."</p>

<p>"I'm not much behind you, Adin, as far as years
go."</p>

<p>"I did hope that Dean would be in a position to
help me when I got along in years. I mistrust I
made a mistake when I let him go out West. If he'd
stayed here, he might have been a good deal of help
to us both."</p>

<p>"Still there didn't seem to be much of a prospect
for the boy."</p>

<p>"He could have managed the farm when he got a
little older."</p>

<p>"That is true, but it has never given you a living,
Adin. You've had to depend upon your trade."</p>

<p>"He could have learned the same trade. A trade's
a good thing for a boy to have to fall back upon."</p>

<p>"He may come back, and realize all your expectations,
Adin. We mustn't despond till we have
reason to."</p>

<p>"There's another thing that's worryin' me, Sarah&mdash;it's
the mortgage. Next week six months' interest
falls due&mdash;twenty-four dollars&mdash;and I haven't the
money to meet it."</p>

<p>"Squire Bates won't push you, surely."</p>

<p>"I don't know. Once or twice lately when I met
the squire he dropped a hint that he was short of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
money. I didn't say much, but it struck me he had
an object in sayin' what he did."</p>

<p>"It's the first time you haven't been ready with
the interest, isn't it, Adin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the very first time."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps he will overlook it this time.
You'd better manage to see him about it."</p>

<p>"I'll do it the first time I see him."</p>

<p>That time came sooner than either of them
thought.</p>

<p>Adin Dunham had scarcely completed his sentence
when a knock was heard at the door (Adin had
never so far fallen in with city customs as to introduce
a door bell.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunham rose and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mrs. Dunham," said the visitor,
suavely.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Squire Bates," said Sarah in surprise.
"Won't you walk in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you. Is your husband at home?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he never goes out in the evening. Adin,"
she said, preceding the visitor, "here is Squire Bates,
who has called to see you."</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, squire," said the carpenter.</p>

<p>"Take a chair, and excuse my gettin' up. My old
enemy, the rheumatism, has got hold of me, and I'm
too stiff to move easy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you are quite excusable, Mr. Dunham. I
am sorry to hear that you are so afflicted."</p>

<p>"It isn't altogether comfortable. Besides, it puts
me behindhand. I've lost at least four weeks this
winter from these rheumatic pains."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and as you can imagine, that is a serious
thing to a poor man."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," assented the squire, coughing.</p>

<p>"I am glad you came in, squire, because I wanted
to speak to you about the interest on that mortgage."</p>

<p>"It falls due next week," said Squire Bates,
promptly.</p>

<p>"Just so, and I am sorry to say that for the first
time I shall be unable to meet it."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" returned the squire, his voice stiffening.
"That is very unfortunate!"</p>

<p>"So it is, squire, but I hope, as it is the first time,
you will overlook it," said Adin Dunham, anxiously.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," said the squire, "it is hardly necessary
to say that I truly sympathize with you. You
believe that, I hope?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would squire. I didn't believe
you'd be hard on me."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you misunderstand me a little, neighbor
Dunham&mdash;I cannot be as considerate as I would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
to be. The fact is, I am <i>very</i> short of money, embarrassed
in fact, and I depended on that payment.
Perhaps you can borrow it?"</p>

<p>"There's no one in the village likely to accommodate
me with a loan unless it's you, squire."</p>

<p>"And I am very short of cash. Indeed it would
hardly do for me to lend you money to pay me, would
it now?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," said the carpenter, ruefully.</p>

<p>"In fact, neighbor Dunham, I came here this evening
to ask if you couldn't arrange to pay the mortgage."</p>

<p>"<i>Pay</i> the mortgage!" echoed Adin Dunham, with
a blank look.</p>

<p>"Yes; I thought you might raise the money in
some way."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell me where, Squire Bates. Eight
hundred dollars! Why it's as big to me as the
national debt! I did expect to pay off the mortgage
with that thousand dollars, that I was so wickedly
robbed of."</p>

<p>"Oh, ah, to be sure! It was a great pity that you
were prevented from doing it."</p>

<p>"That robbery broke me down, Squire Bates. I
believe it has made me five years older, though it
happened less than a year ago. It makes me feel kind
of rebellious at times to think that such a villain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
as the man that robbed me should go unpunished."</p>

<p>"It isn't best to cry over spilt milk," said the squire
who felt obviously uncomfortable under these allusions.</p>

<p>"I can't help thinkin' of it though, squire."</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"When it was gone, I hoped that Dean would be
able to help me to pay up the mortgage some time."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from your nephew lately?"</p>

<p>"Not for months. Have you heard from the man
he went out with?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard several times."</p>

<p>"Does he say anything about Dean?"</p>

<p>"He says&mdash;but perhaps I had better not tell you.
I don't want to distress you," and the squire hesitated.</p>

<p>"Say what you have to say. I can stand it."</p>

<p>"He says he discharged Dean for dishonesty."</p>

<p>"Dean dishonest! Why, squire, you must be
jokin'."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, neighbor Dunham, that there
is no joke about it. Mr. Kirby is not likely to be
mistaken."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Squire Bates," said Adin Dunham
angrily, "that my nephew Dean is as honest as I am
myself. The man that charges him with dishonesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
is a liar! It's a word I don't often use, but I must
use it this time."</p>

<p>"I agree with my husband," said Sarah Dunham,
her mild blue eye sparkling with indignation.
"Nothing would induce Dean to steal."</p>

<p>"Of course you are prejudiced in your nephew's
favor," said the squire with a slight sneer. "It is
very natural, but you can't expect others to agree
with you. However, we will drop this subject. I
am afraid Dean will never be able to help you. I
used to think well of him, though my son Brandon
didn't agree with me."</p>

<p>"What can your son Brandon know of Dean compared
with mother and me, who have known the
boy since his birth?" the carpenter rejoined warmly.</p>

<p>"I won't argue the question, neighbor Dunham.
Indeed I feel for you in your disappointment. But
to come back to business. You mustn't blame me if
I foreclose the mortgage, as the law gives me a right
to do. I wouldn't do it, I assure you, if circumstances
did not make it imperative."</p>

<p>"Foreclose the mortgage!" repeated Adin in consternation.</p>

<p>"Yes, or I'll give you eight hundred dollars for
the place over and above the mortgage."</p>

<p>"Only eight hundred dollars! Why, that would
be robbery!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"Think it over, neighbor Dunham, and don't decide
hastily. You'll think differently, I am sure,
when you have had time to consider it. I must bid
you good-evening now, as I am in haste," and the
squire rose quickly, and left the room, followed to
the door mechanically and in silence by Sarah Dunham.</p>

<p>"Sarah," said the carpenter with grief-stricken
countenance, "this is worse than all. It looks as if
we were indeed forsaken by Providence."</p>

<p>"Hush, Adin! That is wicked. It looks hard,
but the Lord may yet give us deliverance."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we shall end our days in the poorhouse,
Sarah," said the husband gloomily.</p>

<p>"It won't be this year or next, Adin. Eight hundred
dollars will support us for two years, and then
there is your work besides. Let us look on the bright
side!"</p>

<p>But that was not easy for either of them. It seemed
to Adin Dunham that his cup of bitterness was full.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="small">HOW THE MYSTERY WAS SOLVED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We return to Denver, where business required Dean
and Ben Rawson to remain two or three days. Eben
Jones was too impatient to reach home to bear them
company, but started at once for Connecticut. Rawson
and Dean secured a large room in the leading
hotel, which they made their headquarters.</p>

<p>Denver was at that time far from being the handsome
city it has since become. Society was mixed,
and the visitors who were continually arriving and
departing embraced all sorts and conditions of men.
There was no small sprinkling of adventurers, both
good and bad, and it was necessary for the traveler
to be wary and prudent, lest he should fall a prey to
those of the latter kind.</p>

<p>The second night our two friends retired late, having
passed a busy and as it proved profitable day,
for it was on that day Dean effected his purchase of
lots already referred to.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel fagged out, Dean," said Rawson, as he
prepared for bed. "I have been working harder
than I did at the mines."</p>

<p>"I am tired too, but I have passed a pleasant day,"
said Dean. "I think I would rather live here than
at the mines."</p>

<p>"You can have your choice when you return, but
for my part I like the mines. I prefer the freedom
of the mining camp to the restraints of the city."</p>

<p>"There isn't much restraint that I can see."</p>

<p>"There will be. Five years hence Denver will be
a compact city."</p>

<p>"In that case my lots will have risen in value."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it. You have made a good purchase.
But what I was going to say is this. I am
so dead tired that it would take an earthquake to
wake me. Now, as you know, we have considerable
money in the room, besides what we have outside.
Suppose some thief entered our room in the night!"</p>

<p>"I wake easily," said Dean.</p>

<p>"That is lucky. There's a fellow with a hang-dog
look rooms just opposite, whose appearance I don't
like. I have caught him spying about and watching
us closely. I think he is after our money."</p>

<p>"What is his appearance, Ben?"</p>

<p>"He has red hair and a red beard. There is something
in his expression that looks familiar, but I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
place him. I feel sure at any rate that he is a dangerous
man."</p>

<p>"I haven't noticed him, Rawson."</p>

<p>"I have got it into my head somehow that he will
try to enter our room when we are asleep."</p>

<p>"But the door is locked."</p>

<p>"If the man is a professional, he will be able to
get in in spite of that. Now Dean, I want you to
take my revolver and put it under your pillow, to use
in case it should be necessary. Of course you will
wake me also in case of a visit."</p>

<p>"Very well, Ben."</p>

<p>The two undressed and got into bed. There were
two beds in the room, the smaller one being occupied
by Dean. This was placed over against the window,
while Rawson's was closer to the door, on the right.</p>

<p>Dean as well as Rawson, was tired, and soon fell
asleep. But for some reason his sleep was troubled.
He tossed about, and dreamed bad dreams. It might
have been the conversation that had taken place
between Rawson and himself, which shaped the
dreams that disturbed him.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that a man had entered the room,
and was rifling Rawson's pockets. The dream excited
him so much that it awakened him, and none too
soon, for there, bending over the chair on which Rawson
had thrown his clothes, was the very man whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
his companion had described. The moonlight that
flooded the room revealed him clearly, with his red
hair and beard, just as he had presented himself to
Dean in his dreams.</p>

<p>Dean rose to a sitting posture, and quietly drew out
the revolver from underneath his pillow.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The intruder started, and, turning quickly, fixed his
eyes upon Dean. He didn't appear so much alarmed
as angry at the interruption.</p>

<p>"Lie down, and keep still, if you know what's
good for yourself, kid!" he said, in a menacing tone.</p>

<p>"And let you rob my friend? Not much!" said
Dean, boldly. "Lay down those clothes!"</p>

<p>"When I get ready."</p>

<p>"I command you to lay them down!" said Dean,
boldly.</p>

<p>"I'll wring your neck if you don't keep quiet," said
the robber, quietly.</p>

<p>"Rawson!" cried Dean, raising his voice.</p>

<p>"Confusion!" muttered the thief, as, dropping his
booty, he took a step towards Dean's bed.</p>

<p>"Look out for yourself!" said Dean, in a tone of
warning. "Come nearer, and I fire!"</p>

<p>Then for the first time the intruder noticed that the
boy was armed. He drew back cautiously.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>Just then Rawson asked sleepily, "What's the matter,
Dean?"</p>

<p>"Wake up, Rawson, quick!" said Dean.</p>

<p>Ben Rawson opened his eyes, and took in the
situation at once. He sprang from the bed, and
placed himself between the thief and the door.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" exclaimed the intruder, as he made
a dash forward, only to be seized by the powerful
miner.</p>

<p>"Now let me know who you are, and whether you
have taken anything," he said, resolutely. "Dean,
let us have some light."</p>

<p>The thief struggled to escape, but in vain. His
captor was stronger than himself. Dean lighted the
gas, and both scrutinized the thief closely. Then a
light flashed upon Dean.</p>

<p>"I know him in spite of his false hair and beard,"
he said. "It's Peter Kirby."</p>

<p>Rawson pulled off the disguise, and Kirby stood
revealed.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's Kirby!" he said, doggedly. "What are
you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Put you in the hands of the police," answered
Rawson, coolly.</p>

<p>Kirby remained silent a moment, and then said:
"I'll make it worth your while to let me go."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Rawson, briefly.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>"That boy's uncle was robbed near a year since of
a thousand dollars. I can tell him the name of the
thief."</p>

<p>"Was it Squire Bates?" asked Dean, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Till my safety is assured I can tell nothing."</p>

<p>"Can you enable me to recover the money?"</p>

<p>"I can. I will be willing to make a statement, and
swear to it before a magistrate."</p>

<p>"Is not Squire Bates the head of a gang of robbers?"</p>

<p>"I am not prepared to say. I will do what I
agreed."</p>

<p>Rawson and Dean conferred together briefly, and
decided to release Kirby on the terms proposed.
But it was necessary to wait till morning, and they
didn't dare to release him. They tied the villain
hand and foot, and kept him in this condition till daylight.
Then they took him before a magistrate, his
statement was written out and sworn to, and they
released him.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have done this," said Kirby, "if Bates
had treated me right; but he has been working against
me, and I have sworn to get even."</p>

<p>Dean did not trouble himself about Kirby's motives,
but he was overjoyed to think that through his means
the mystery at Waterford had been solved at last, and
his uncle would recover his property.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I shall go home happy," he said to Rawson,
"for I shall carry happiness to my good uncle and
aunt."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="small">ADIN DUNHAM'S TROUBLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Arriving in New York, Dean was tempted to buy
a handsome suit of clothes, being fully able to spare
the money. But on second thought he contented
himself with purchasing a cheap, ready-made suit at
one of the large clothing stores on the Bowery. He
wanted to surprise his uncle and aunt. Besides, he
wished to see what kind of a reception his old
friends would give him if he appeared in shabby attire
and apparent poverty. He could let them know
the truth later on.</p>

<p>The evening before his arrival in Waterford Adin
Dunham had another call from Squire Bates.</p>

<p>"Have you got my interest ready, neighbor Dunham?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"No, squire; I can give you a part of it, as I told
you the other day."</p>

<p>"That will not answer," said Bates in an uncompromising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
tone. "I need the money at once.
Some of my recent investments have paid me poorly,
and though I would like to be considerate I cannot
favor you."</p>

<p>"I will try to borrow the money. Perhaps Dean
can let me have twenty dollars."</p>

<p>"Dean!" repeated Squire Bates with a sneer.
"Do you think I can wait till you hear from him?"</p>

<p>"I have heard from him," answered the carpenter.</p>

<p>"You have heard from your nephew! Where is
he?" Squire Bates asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Here is his letter. It came to hand this morning."</p>

<p>Squire Bates took the proffered letter and read as
follows:</p>


<p class="sigright p2t"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, July 15.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Uncle and Aunt</span>:&mdash;I have got so far on my
way home from the West. I will remain here a day
or two. Perhaps I can hear of a place, as I suppose
there is nothing for me to do in Waterford. I think
I shall be with you on Saturday.</p>

<p class="sigright p2b">Your affectionate nephew,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
<span class="smcap">Dean Dunham</span>.</p>


<p>"He doesn't appear to have made his fortune,"
said the squire, handing back the letter to the carpenter.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>"He doesn't say whether he has prospered or
not."</p>

<p>"If he had he wouldn't be looking for a boy's
position in New York."</p>

<p>"Very likely you're right, Squire Bates. It's
something that he has been able to get home to his
friends."</p>

<p>"Wait till you've seen him," said the Squire, significantly.
"He will probably return home in
rags."</p>

<p>"Even if he does he will be welcome," rejoined
the carpenter warmly. "Even if he comes home
without a penny, he won't lack for a welcome, will
he, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"I should think not, Adin," said his wife in mild
indignation.</p>

<p>"That is all very pretty and sentimental," said
the Squire. "Perhaps you have a fatted calf to kill
for the returning prodigal."</p>

<p>"Dean never was a prodigal," answered Adin
Dunham. "If your friend had treated him well he
might have had some money to return with. It
wasn't a very creditable thing to throw the poor boy
upon his own resources so far away from home."</p>

<p>"We spoke on that subject yesterday, and I distinctly
told you that Mr. Kirby had a very good
reason to discharge Dean. You didn't agree with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
me. I suppose it is natural to stand up for your
own. However, I will give you three days to make
up the interest. That will carry us to Monday. But
I shall also require you to pay the mortgage, or else
accept my offer for the place. I will give you another
week to do that."</p>

<p>Squire Bates went out of the room, leaving Adin
and Sarah Dunham in some trouble of mind. There
seemed to be no help for it. They must be dispossessed
of what had been their home for many years.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="small">THE CLOUDS ROLL BY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Just before leaving Denver, Dean, in passing
through Lawrence Street, came upon a boy, miserably
clad, who held in his hand a few daily papers
which he was trying to sell. There was something
in the boy's face that looked familiar.</p>

<p>"Guy Gladstone!" he exclaimed in great surprise.</p>

<p>"Dean Dunham!" replied Guy, looking both
pleased and ashamed.</p>

<p>"How came you here? I thought you were hunting
Indians on the prairies."</p>

<p>Guy blushed scarlet.</p>

<p>"Don't say a word about it!" he replied. "I
was a fool and I have suffered for my folly."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"I got out of money and have nearly starved. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
have done anything I could to make a little money.
I have blacked boots, set up pins in a bowling alley,
and now I am selling papers."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go home?"</p>

<p>"I would if I had the money."</p>

<p>"Then you shall have the money. I start East to-morrow,
and will take you along with me."</p>

<p>"Then you have prospered?" asked the wondering
Guy.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not all the time. I have seen hard
times, too. Mr. Kirby discharged me, and I lived
some time by giving concerts on the harmonica."</p>

<p>"Really and truly!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dean, laughing. "I don't
wonder you are surprised. But here, give away
your papers to that newsboy across the street and
come to my hotel."</p>

<p>"But I haven't any money."</p>

<p>"I have enough for both."</p>

<p>Dean had the pleasure of restoring Guy to his
family, who received him kindly. It is safe to say
that he will never again go West in quest of Indians.</p>

<p>A little before noon on Saturday Dean reached
Waterford, and walked home. On the way he met
Brandon Bates.</p>

<p>"Halloa, so you're back!" said Brandon, eying
him curiously.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Brandon. Thank you for your warm welcome."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to give you a warm welcome,"
said Brandon, ungraciously.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; I made a mistake."</p>

<p>"I suppose you came home without a cent."</p>

<p>"You're mistaken. I've got over a dollar in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"What's a dollar?" sneered Brandon.</p>

<p>"It isn't much, to be sure."</p>

<p>"You won't hear very good news at your uncle's."</p>

<p>"Why? Is he sick&mdash;or my aunt?" asked Dean
uneasily.</p>

<p>"No, but he can't pay the mortgage, and my
father's going to take possession of the place."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all?" said Dean, relieved.</p>

<p>"I should think it was enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps your father will think better of it,
as I am at home now and can help Uncle Adin pay
it off."</p>

<p>"What can you do?" asked Brandon, mockingly.</p>

<p>"That's the great question. However, I'm in a
hurry to get home, and must leave you. You are
kind to be so much interested in me, Brandon."</p>

<p>"I'm not interested in you at all," returned Brandon,
tartly.</p>

<p>Dean laughed and passed on.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>"That boy's as impudent as ever," soliloquized
Brandon. "He'll feel differently on Monday."</p>

<p>In the joy of seeing Dean again his uncle and aunt
lost sight for a time of their troubles, but after a
while Adin Dunham said gravely, "It's well you
came home as you did, Dean, for the old home is
about to pass from me."</p>

<p>"How is that, Uncle Adin?"</p>

<p>"Squire Bates is going to foreclose the mortgage.
He offers to buy the place and give me eight hundred
dollars over and above what I owe him."</p>

<p>"Of course you declined?"</p>

<p>"It will do no good. I must yield to necessity."</p>

<p>"Squire Bates shall never have the place," said
Dean, resolutely.</p>

<p>"Who will prevent it?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"But, Dean, what power have you? The squire
is firmly resolved."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle Adin, ask me no questions, but rest easy
in the thought that you won't lose your home.
Leave the matter in my hands. That is all you need
to do."</p>

<p>"Sarah, what does the boy mean?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>"He means something, Adin. We may as well
leave it in his hands as he asks."</p>

<p>"Very well, I don't know as he can do any harm&mdash;or
good."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen, uncle."</p>

<p>Dean went to church on Sunday, and received a
warm welcome from nearly all the congregation, for
he was popular with those of all ages. He wore a
smiling, untroubled look which puzzled Squire Bates
and Brandon.</p>

<p>"Does he know that I am going to foreclose the
mortgage?" asked the squire of Brandon.</p>

<p>"Yes, for I told him."</p>

<p>"It seems strange that he should be so cheerful."</p>

<p>"He won't be&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No, I apprehend not."</p>


<hr class="style1" />


<p>When Squire Bates called at the carpenter's modest
home Dean opened the door, and invited him into
the sitting-room, where the two found themselves
alone.</p>

<p>"I want to see your uncle," said the squire.</p>

<p>"If it's about the mortgage, I will attend to that
matter."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;a boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel competent to settle the matter."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"There is only one way of settling it, by paying
the money."</p>

<p>"I propose to pay it as soon as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, as soon as what?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you restore to my uncle, with interest,
the thousand dollars you stole from him nearly a
year since."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by this insolence?" demanded
Squire Bates, springing to his feet and glaring at
Dean.</p>

<p>"I mean," answered Dean, slowly, "that I have
the sworn testimony of Peter Kirby, given me at
Denver, implicating you in that robbery."</p>

<p>"Show it to me," said the squire, turning livid.</p>

<p>"Here is a copy. The original is in the hands of
a New York lawyer."</p>

<p>Squire Bates took the paper in his trembling fingers,
and read it deliberately.</p>

<p>"This is a lie!" he exclaimed hoarsely.</p>

<p>"The matter can come before the courts if you
wish it. My uncle recognized you at the time of the
robbery, but no one would believe his testimony.
Fortunately, it will be substantiated now."</p>

<p>"But this is the most utter absurdity. Does anybody
believe that a man of my reputation would be
implicated in a highway robbery?"</p>

<p>"They will find it equally hard to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
you are the captain of a band of robbers with headquarters
in Colorado. I have been in the cave where
your booty is congealed, and know what I am talking
about."</p>

<p>After fifteen minutes more the squire capitulated,
only making it a condition that Dean would keep
secret the serious discoveries which he had made.</p>

<p>"I will do so, unless I am summoned to testify in
court," said Dean.</p>

<p>"Leave me to explain matters to your uncle," said
the squire.</p>

<p>Dean called the carpenter into the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dunham," said Squire Bates with his old
suavity, "I have arranged matters satisfactorily with
your nephew. He has recovered the large sum of
which you were robbed a year ago, and paid the
mortgage, or is prepared to do so. Dean, if you
will accompany me to my office we will arrange this
affair."</p>

<p>"But, who stole the money?" asked Adin Dunham,
bewildered.</p>

<p>"I promised not to tell," said Dean. "Was I
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, as long as you got the money back."</p>

<p>Dean received the mortgage back canceled, and
something over two hundred dollars besides, which
he placed in his uncle's hands. Adin Dunham looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
ten years younger, and his face was radiant. His
joy was increased when Dean told him how he had
prospered out West, and gave his aunt five hundred
dollars, reserving for himself the remainder of the
thousand which he had brought home.</p>

<p>Two months later Dean returned to Denver to find
that his lots had considerably increased in value.
Gradually he sold them off for twice what he paid,
and entered business in the Queen City of Colorado.</p>

<p>Squire Bates soon removed from Waterford, and
the villagers have heard nothing of him since. But
Dean could tell them that his connection with the
band of robbers was discovered, and that he is upon
conviction serving a protracted term in a Western
prison. What has become of Brandon or his mother
is not known to the general public, but it is less than
a year since Dean, while leaving the Denver post-office,
was accosted by a shabbily dressed young
man who asked for assistance.</p>

<p>"Are you not Brandon Bates?" asked Dean after
a brief glance.</p>

<p>Brandon was about to hurry away, but Dean detained
him. "Don't go," he said. "I am glad to
help you," and he placed two gold eagles in the
hands of the astonished Brandon.</p>

<p>"Come to me again if you are in need," said Dean
in a friendly manner.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you! I didn't expect this from you,"
said Brandon. "I thought you would triumph over
me."</p>

<p>"If I did I should show myself unworthy of the
good fortune that has come to me. I wish you good
luck."</p>

<p>That was the last Dean has seen of Brandon. Let
us hope that he will deserve good luck, and attain
it.</p>

<p>Adin Dunham still lives, happy in the companionship
of his good wife, and the prosperity of his
nephew. But there is one thing that puzzles him.
He has never been able to solve <span class="smcap">The Waterford
Mystery</span>.</p>

BURT L. STANDISH.</span></p>

<p>No modern series of tales for boys and youths has met with anything
like the cordial reception and popularity accorded to the Frank
Merriwell Stories. There must be a reason for this and there is.
Frank Merriwell, as portrayed by the author, is a jolly whole-souled,
honest, courageous American lad, who appeals to the hearts of the
boys. He has no bad habits, and his manliness inculcates the idea
that it is not necessary for a boy to indulge in petty vices to be a hero.
Frank Merriwell's example is a shining light for every ambitious lad
to follow. Six volumes now ready:</p>

  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
